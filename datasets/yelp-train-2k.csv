pos	My wife took me here on my birthday for breakfast and it was excellent.  The weather was perfect which made sitting outside overlooking their grounds an absolute pleasure.  Our waitress was excellent and our food arrived quickly on the semi-busy Saturday morning.  It looked like the place fills up pretty quickly so the earlier you get here the better.  Do yourself a favor and get their Bloody Mary.  It was phenomenal and simply the best I've ever had.  I'm pretty sure they only use ingredients from their garden and blend them fresh when you order it.  It was amazing.  While EVERYTHING on the menu looks excellent I had the white truffle scrambled eggs vegetable skillet and it was tasty and delicious.  It came with 2 pieces of their griddled bread with was amazing and it absolutely made the meal complete.  It was the best \"toast\" I've ever had.  Anyway I can't wait to go back!
neg	U can go there n check the car out. If u wanna buy 1 there? That's wrong move! If u even want a car service from there? U made a biggest mistake of ur life!! I had 1 time asked my girlfriend to take my car there for an oil service guess what? They ripped my girlfriend off by lying how bad my car is now. If without fixing the problem. Might bring some serious accident. Then she did what they said. 4 brand new tires timing belt 4 new brake pads. U know why's the worst? All of those above I had just changed 2 months before!!! What a trashy dealer is that? People better off go somewhere!
pos	I have no idea why some people give bad reviews about this place. It goes to show you you can please everyone. They are probably griping about something that their own fault...there are many people like that.  In any case my friend and I arrived at about 5:50 PM this past Sunday. It was pretty crowded more than I thought for a Sunday evening and thought we would have to wait forever to get a seat but they said we'll be seated when the girl comes back from seating someone else. We were seated at 5:52 and the waiter came and got our drink orders. Everyone was very pleasant from the host that seated us to the waiter to the server. The prices were very good as well. We placed our orders once we decided what we wanted at 6:02. We shared the baked spaghetti calzone and the small \"Here's The Beef\" pizza so we can both try them. The calzone was huge and we got the smallest one (personal) and got the small 11\" pizza. Both were awesome! My friend liked the pizza better and I liked the calzone better. The calzone does have a sweetish sauce but that's how I like my sauce!  We had to box part of the pizza to take it home and we were out the door by 6:42. So everything was great and not like these bad reviewers. That goes to show you that  you have to try these things yourself because all these bad reviewers have some serious issues.
neg	Disgusting!  Had a Groupon so my daughter and I tried it out.  Very outdated and gaudy 80's style interior made me feel like I was in an episode of Sopranos.  The food itself was pretty bad.  We ordered pretty simple dishes but they just had no flavor at all!  After trying it out I'm positive all the good reviews on here are employees or owners creating them.
pos	Rosie Dakota and I LOVE Chaparral Dog Park!!! It's very convenient and surrounded by a lot of paths a desert xeriscape baseball fields ballparks and a lake with ducks.  The Scottsdale Park and Rec Dept. does a wonderful job of keeping the park clean and shaded.  You can find trash cans and poopy-pick up mitts located all over the park and paths.  The fenced in area is huge to let the dogs run play and sniff!
neg	I've eaten here many times but none as bad as last night. Service was excellent and highly attentive. Food absolutely horrible.  My expectation was they would serve a steak on par with their seafood. After all they were charging 39 bucks for a ribeye.  What I was hoping for was a 1- 1-1/2' thick steak cooked Pittsburgh style as I had ordered.  What I got a a 3/4 in thick piece of meat that was mostly fat gristle and in no way resembled Pittsburgh Style.  Salad similar to something you could get at Chick Filet Veggies blah. Bread basket ample but day old and if not it certainly wasn't fresh.   In addition to bad food we were crammed into a small room where we were nuts to butts with 6 other tables listening to conversations ranging from someone's recent bout with pinkeye and another couple who elected to speak entirely in French until the waiter showed up then it was like they turned off the French switch and suddenly began speaking English.   I've had it with this place. If I'm going to pay 150 bucks for dinner it'll be at Mortons or Maestro where the steaks are 1-1/2 in thick cooked to perfection and half of it doesnt wind up on the plate as fat and gristle
pos	General Manager Scott Petello is a good egg!!! Not to go into detail but let me assure you if you have any issues (albeit rare) speak with Scott and treat the guy with some respect as you state your case and I'd be surprised if you don't walk out totally satisfied as I just did. Like I always say..... \"Mistakes are inevitable it's how we recover from them that is important\"!!!  Thanks to Scott and his awesome staff. You've got a customer for life!! .......... :^)
neg	I have always been a fan of Burlington's deals however I will not be shopping at this one again. I went to return a belt... pretty simple. Instead I stood in the customer service line for 15 minutes thanks to an employee of Burlington buying/putting things on layaway. It took three other staff to help her out. There were no words said to me except \"Hold on\". I was pissed. When the lady was finally done the employee at the service asked \"what do you want?\" Serious help is needed there!  If you work in the area of \"customer service\" I think you should have some.
pos	Drop what you're doing and drive here. After I ate here I had to go back the next day for more.  The food is that good.  This cute little green building may have gone competely unoticed if I hadn't been driving down Palm Rd to avoid construction.  While waiting to turn onto 16th Street the \"Grand Opening\" sign caught my eye and my little yelping soul leaped for joy!  A new place to try!  It looked desolate from the outside but when I opened the door I was put at easy by the decor smell and cleanliness inside.  I ordered dinner for two to go.  The menu was awesome.  I loved seeing all the variety: poblano peppers mole mahi mahi mushrooms...something wrapped in banana leaves.  It made it difficult to choose something.  Here's what I've had so far: La Condesa Shrimp Burro and Baja Sur Dogfish Shark Taco.  They are both were very delicious meals but the shrimp burro stole the show.  So much flavor.  I snagged some bites from my hubbys mole and mahi mahi burros- mmmm such a delight.  The salsa bar is endless.  I really stocked up.  I was excited to try the strawberry salsa but it was too hot in fact it all was but I'm a big wimp when it comes to hot peppers. The horchata is handmade and delicious.  They throw pecans and some fruit in there too which is a yummy bonus!  As if the good food wasn't enough to win me over the art in this restaurant sho did!  I'm a sucker for Mexican folk art and Frida Kahlo is my Oprah.  There's a painting of her and Diego hanging over the salsa bar it's amazing.  All the paintings are great love the artist.
neg	Another night meeting friends here.  I have to laugh.  Waited another 20 minutes for my beer to be refilled at the bar.  A girl even took my empty without even asking if I wanted a refill.  A new brunette girl that I don't recognize left the bar and sat down with her guy friends on the customer side AT 9:25 ON A FRIDAY NIGHT.  Another bartender had to ask her to come back and work.  Management....  Pull your head out of your ass!  Sad to watch....  I need to talk my friends into another place!
pos	Nobuo shows his unique talents with everything on the menu. Carefully crafted features with much to drink. Start with the pork belly buns and a stout. Then go on until you can no longer.
neg	Not busy at all but took nearly 45 min to get our meal.  Ordered the trout and was shocked to see lots and lots of bones. Hmmmmm. Well asked the waitress about it and she said \"they try the best they can\"  hmmmmmm isn't this a \"fish\" restaurant?  They comped the trout but still not sure I would go back.
pos	The oldish man who owns the store is as sweet as can be.  Perhaps sweeter than the cookies or ice cream.  Here's the lowdown: Giant ice cream cookie sandwiches for super cheap.  The flavor permutations are basically endless.  I had snickerdoodle with cookies and cream ice cream.  It was marvelous.
neg	Yikes reading other reviews I realize my bad experience wasn't unique. As a server I make a very laid back customer. I like pretty much everything I eat and don't require a lot of attention from the waiter.   La Piccola Cucina would benefit from just one extra person in the front of the house. Our guy though adorable and friendly was too busy to refill our drinks and to remember to bring our appetizer (though charged us for it). The ahi tuna (highly recommended over the other fish options he said) was so overcooked it was the color and consistency of chicken. Like other reviewers mentioned he was frantic and made that clear to every customer. At one point I even saw him in the kitchen cooking - they need another person!   I left super stressed out from the experience which is very very unusual for me. You can either have bad service or bad food but not both.
pos	Wonderful Vietnamese sandwich shoppe. Their baguettes are great hot out of the oven with butter or in one of their many sandwich choices. They have a modest selection of baked goods along with some of the best egg rolls around. Bring cash or your ATM card as no credit cards are accepted but they have an ATM on premises.
neg	This is my first year participating in Arizona to sell clothing just wandering how busy its goona be in there ??? little worried can any one reply me ??
pos	They have a limited time thing going on right now with BBQ chicken pizza (not sure how long it's going to last) but let me just say it was amazing.  Probably THE best BBQ Chicken pizza I have ever had.  I have tried other things too like the tomato basil soup and many of their sandwiches ... very good very fresh - every time.    The 5 stars is for the pizza but if I were to rate Jason's Deli over all they would get about a 4.
neg	really I can't believe this place has received such high reviews from people.  my lady and i walked in and were greeted rather rudely by a pretentious bitch at the front with a monotone \"name please?\" instead of a warm friendly french welcome to this rather charming looking place. we didn't have a reservation which from the looks of how dead empty the place was didn't seem like a problem. until the hostess whisked through her reservation list and explained she'd try to \"fit us in\". it was 6pm the place had one other couple dining and we were informed that the next party was arriving at 7:30. we weren't really looking to hang out. it would have be awfully lovely if yelpers would have informed of the need to MAKE RESERVATIONS before going in here because if you don't you're automatically a piece of shit according to the staff. sorry i don't plan very much ahead. next time i will and it won't be here.  anyways after debating for a minute or two with herself the hostess decided we could \"squeeze in\" and sat us right on top of the other couple inside the restaurant. she informed us that we could cork our own wine for their low low price of 9 fucking dollars. in words only office space could adequately describe\"coup des tartes what is it exactly that you do?\".   the food was good nothing spectacular for $25+ a plate. we got a salad with apples and nuts and bleu cheese which was served warm. now this is the first warm salad i've had all of my life and by no means am i some sort of wordly food expert but i believe salad should be cold and crisp. not soggy and warm. yuck. the cordon bleu was tasty and filling however the wobbly table was an extreme annoyance when cutting through the chicken but it was solved (with no thanks to the staff) by placing a jack-in-the-box gift card under the leg. i will admit the mashed potatoes are some of the creamiest and best i've ever had. my lady got the pork tenderloin which had a strange peppery-sweet pairing which i didn't particularly care for. we were broke for desert so unfortunately we didn't get to try any tarts. you would think for a place that promotes itself as being so poise would get some fancier menus other than a $.15 piece of cardstock copied in bulk at kinkos.  this place was rather disappointing. i honestly thought it would be way more comfy and welcoming inside but it really wasn't. it presents itself as being so high class and french and oh-la-la wee wee but when it comes down to it it's still located in a tiny shack of a house at 16th street and highland. maybe if it were located in the biltmore i'd give it a bit more cred.
pos	okay this is the best place EVER! i grew up shopping at the one in los gatos and the one in Oakville. i was shock when i saw the best store in the world in Scottsdale and then not surprised at all. the have all the good stuff. from cheese down to wine. i can't tell you how happy i am that this store is here in Arizona. now if we could just get dean and deluca!
neg	I was really excited about this event maybe my expectations were too high because I was really underwhelmed.  Very little shade ran out of water by the time I got there at 1pm (other obligations) 20\% of the vendors were out of food and by the time I ate my way through some everyone else was already out.   60 bucks for that?  I don't think so.    And when I mentioned it to \"the person in charge\" he was patronizing invalidating and kept telling me how happy the chefs were.  Well I'm your consumer big guy.    Sorry Devoured wish it could have been better.   What food I did try was pretty good.
pos	This place shouldn't even be reviewed - because it is the kind of place I want to keep for myself...  =)
neg	The beach paradise of Ixtapa-Zihuatenejo awaited us....unfortunately so did a connecting flight in ARIZONA of all places...  Long story short....1/3 of our luggage did not arrive at our final destination various articles of our clothing are still missing as well as my cell phone charger...not to mention security forcing us to open sealed containers of my son's baby food and milk for litmus tests...  I looked on the bright side....at least we didn't get deported =)
pos	first time my friend and I went there... it was delicious!  The food garlic knots our favorite and of course the wine!  We will be going back ALOT!
neg	See the huge sign outside that says $2.50? Yeah that's for shirts only. I was caught off guard when I brought in my skirt and got nailed for about $3.79. As I sadly handed over my $5 bill the lady at the counter said a lot of people had told her they felt betrayed by the sign outside. No kidding. I had originally been heading down the street to Regal on 7th Ave.--who does a fine job in half the pickup time--for the \"advertised\" fake price here. Trying to make the best of it  I told the lady at least I'd learned they had an onsite alteration service and maybe that was worth a buck. UH OH. Picked up my skirt a few weeks later with some Jersey Shore-type chick at the counter and was told I owed another $3.79. I flat-out refused to pay twice. She screamed at me chased me to my car wrote down my license plate and said the police would be visiting. Ni-i-i-ice.
pos	I love this place! I have been coming here for ages. My favorites: Elsa's Chicken sandwich any of their burgers dragon chicken wings china's little chicken sandwich and the hot pepper chicken sandwich. The atmosphere is always fun and the art they display is very abstract but totally cool!
neg	Unless you are a regular or look like your wallet is fat don't expect the best service.  Entrees cost about 20-38 bucks and Anti pasta runs between 5-20 desserts are all 8 bucks unless you get aged balsamic vinegar.  They also have a big cheese selection.   I made reservations for this restaurant and they sat us by the back door.  The waiter never once explained anything on the menu or suggested a wine to go with our meal.  He didn't even tell us about the cheese menu except to check on the one we wanted.  The other waiter for a table near ours went out of his way to explain the menu and go as far as to tell his tables how to eat the cheese ( it comes with jelly's and such) .    My meal was good I had the duck.  She had the salmon which tasted very fishy.  Not fresh at all.  The wine was 40 bucks for a carafe ( maybe if we would have got a 100 dollar bottle we would have gotten better service)  The Dessert was good it was a rich chocolate cake with nuts and chocolate sauce. Nothing too special.    Overall the experience made the meal not worth the 115 bucks in these times not to mention they overcharged my girls card for the drinks at the bar.  If we dont want to give 25\% don't charge it plain and simple.    Just a warning reservations and customer service mean nothing.  We mentioned our complaints to the waiter and manager.  We received an apology but how bout comp our dessert or something.  Hyatt Gainey staff is also rude for the most part.    Two thumbs way down.
pos	I love love LOVE this place. My boss (who is into healthy eating) recommended this place. I went over with some highly skeptical friends and one dinner was enough to convert them into believers! The food here is so good! We had the Shrimp dumplings and the Onion tart as starters. We ordered the Shirataki noodles and street tacos as entrees. So also ordered the Kale-aid. All of the dishes were yummy.  I have gone back many times since then and have never been disappointed! I have gone after yoga to get some Kale salad or the chicken chopped salad. I always have to get the Kale aid.  Once a guy at the next table uprooted a whole plant by mistake (on the patio) and was highly embarrassed as was his date! Ever since I have very careful not to throw my arms around as I can be quite clumsy sometimes! I do NOT want to be banned from my favorite place for my clumsiness! I don't think I can live without True Food!
neg	Take your money elsewhere unless you've got kids.  I really try to like this place.  A family member signed me up for the discount card so I've been going more often but I just don't love it.  It's simply ok but the prices are outrageous.  And the sounds and animatronics are a huge distraction from the so-so food.  The cocktails are alright but again the price is not right.  The ony thing fun about the place for an adult is the gift shop and the light-up cocktail glasses (which cost extra.)  I've seen a lot of happy families in here though so I bet it's better if you have little ones to bring along.
pos	Disclaimer: Like many of you I am a sucker for charming little homes that have been re-purposed into restaurants. I am certain that this colored my opinion of Cibo.  That being said I absolutely love having lunch here the other day. I unknowingly arrived at 2:05 (5 minutes after they close between lunch and dinner) but was served anyway. I had the salscicia sandwich and a side of fruit. The sandwich was excellent served on perfectly crisp chewy saltimbocca bread. The sausage was flavorful and was complimented by roasted red peppers and onions. All this was finished off with a great quality mozzarella cheese. Really really delicious.  I should also say that the atmosphere here was friendly and  comfortable though a bit small. This would be a great place to hang out if you lived nearby.
neg	My friend kept telling me how good their lunches are... I tried it but it didn't do anything for me.  The sandwich tasted like something you can get at Safeway but twice the price.  For being called a Purveyor of Fine Foods I expected the food to taste like not just any ordinary sandwich.   What I had: Ham cheese with portobello mushrooms on a panini with 2 sides of pasta one was parmesan and the other was macaroni. Maybe it was the panini bread. I think the parmesan pasta was made there but I know for sure the macaroni was not made there it tasted like something I had at a picnic which was in a carton. It wasn't anything to brag home about.   I found out the head chef made my sandwich... keep him in the kitchen and away from the customers no personality whatsoever. I asked for his suggestion and his reaction was \"anythings good.\"   Normally when I go to AJ's I go for their desserts. Their desserts are fabulous and you can get individual servings at a reasonable price.  I can take an assortment home and have them for later.   Our company does use them for their catering and I've had many compliments on their dishes but pass on the lunches.
pos	Never having dealt with a Discount Tire in Phoenix before (only in Texas and their service has been great all the time) I came in not knowing what kind of service to expect. I was pleasantly surprised! The store had a good amount of parking and the store front was clean open and had adequate seating around the perimeters. There were already 5-6 people sitting and waiting for their cars to be finished and 2 people waiting infront of me to see a representative. All the guys working there were busy helping someone yet were saying hello to us and reassuring they'd get to us very soon. I didn't wait an unneccesary amount of time and then was helped by Wally. He inspected my tires recommended a plan of action gave me options and we headed back into the store. After I made my decision to replace 2 of the tires he checked their stock and unfortunately they didn't have them there. BUT he called another store and had them picked up for the next morning so I could just come back the next day to this same store and get those bad boys installed. Great! The prices were not as heafty (relief) and although there were a good amount of people the next day waiting for their cars to also be serviced it took exactly the amount of time they'd told me (45 min). They apologized for the wait but no need for that! The guy who helped me on the 2nd day (I'm sorry I forgot his name) was also very professional and great. I recommend this store and will be bringing my car here in the future most definitely. Thanks guys!  TIP: If you know you need to bring your car in you can make an appointment with them online. They take walk-ins but I believe it helps them manage their customers easier and that in turn benefits you.
neg	Absolutely horrendous.  This post office will lose your mail (repeatedly) laugh about it to your face lie about it blow it off make it seem like it's your fault and make you wish you had sent it UPS.
pos	(Un)fortunately for me lux is close to my house.  I walk there nearly every day and am much poorer because of it.  The coffee and pastries are amazing.  They always play really great music too!
neg	Other than the really great happy hour prices its hit or miss with this place. More often a miss. :(  The food is less than average the drinks NOT strong ( at least they are inexpensive)  but the service is truly hit or miss.  I'll pass.
pos	Fred M. pretty much said what I would say so I won't beat a dead horse.  I'll add though that they offer a wide variety of deep-fried quesadillas.    Did you catch that?  DEEP FRIED QUESADILLAS!
neg	Been here for many years but have seen a recent decline in quality service. Felt scolded by the bartender today at lunch. Felt disrespected as a customer. Service sucks stay away. \"bad service = bad review\"
pos	Alright I have been away from Yelp for quite some time and I feel that this place is fitting to be my comeback review...  Chicken and Waffles.  Yes chicken and M'Fin waffles.    In the ghetto?  Check Has sweet tea?  Check Has no-nonsense quick service?  Check Ridiculously long wait?  Check Best thing that I have eaten in the last year?  Check  I have to say not the best fried chicken I have ever had but pretty damn good- it could use more seasoning.  Now the waffles probably the best ever...  The waffles are deliciously soft inside a little crispy out with a wonderful cinammoness to them.  The seating is cramped but it doesn't matter as soon as your food is delivered your table goes quiet you get tunnel vision and after the first bite you are taken away to an orgy of goodness.  If you are in Phoenix this is a requirement.  Come real early or be prepared to wait.  Don't forget to order the Red Velvet cake and they have Kool-Aid if that fits your fancy.  Even after I came home from Arizona I couldn't stop talking about LoLo's for like 2 weeks.  Shoot two months later and I am still drooling thinking about it...
neg	This place is not there anymore.
pos	This restaurant is incredible and has the best pasta carbonara and the best tiramisu I've had in my life. All the food is wonderful though. The calamari is not fried. The bread served with dinner comes right out of the oven and the tomatoes are the freshest I've tasted outside of my mom's own garden. This is great attention to detail.  I can no longer eat at any other Italian restaurant without feeling slighted. This is the first place I want take out-of-town visitors I'm looking to impress.  The owner Jon is helpful friendly and really cares about providing a positive dining experience. He's spot on with his wine recommendations and he organizes wine tasting events which you can find out about by joining the mailing list or Facebook page.
neg	Rarely do I give a 1 star rating but after four attempts in four months to get my fax line and internet rolling I can honestly say they have earned this.  After finally showing up for a scheduled appointment the tech told us our internet was fine but we disagree because we are getting the same speed we had with Qwest in Cave Creek (SLOW)  and they are charging us $64 a month for what they call the upgraded 20mbs.  Furthermore I tried to send out a couple faxes after he left and the line is not responding.  Im going to drive down to the store tomorrow and demand that they remove the fees for service I have not received and just get efax.  As I noted in the first review we were excited to upgrade to faster internet so that makes this experience even worse.
pos	This an incredible church that embraces the principle that ......Christ Life Church exists to bring people into a life-changing relationship with Jesus Christ.  Three campuses allow Christ Life to reach into several locations...online Tempe and Casa Grande.   The wonderful children's and youth programs appeal to a wide perspective of people.
neg	What a load of absolutely hideous uninteresting crap.  Take every single one-star review written by Yelpers below copypaste them here and you will have a far more eloquent summary of my feelings on this place than anything I can come up with.  I have no reason to ever come here. Certainly not free will. The one time I did come here I was forced to by a friend who was meeting another friend.
pos	This is our favorite breakfast place. The food is good. They have the best biscuits & gravy of any restaurant I have eaten at. The wait staff is friendly. The only complaint I have is that Sunday mornings are packed so there can be a wait to be seated.
neg	Wednesday 7pm.  This place is your average over priced lack of taste chain food restaurant and this place was no different.   I have to say I was super disappointed as I have always heard rave reviews now I'm starting to question who I associate with and their taste in food.  Service=slow. Food=just tastes like salt Noise=loud and they do a dance...like a lot.  Go somewhere else and skip Joe's Crabs.
pos	I had looked at several invitation websites along with catalogs with no luck in finding just the right balance of wedding colors/design.  Thomas at Alphagraphics helped me every step of the way of designing and printing our wedding invitations and programs.  I knew I wanted a booklet-style but needed a little design creativity from Alphagraphics which they nailed!  I highly recommend Alphagraphics to anyone needing any print work done - not just wedding invitations.  Thomas and his crew are stellar!!
neg	I had not been to an Oregano's in like 10 years. They seems to be popping up all over here in AZ now so my buddy was in from out of town and he wanted to try so why not.  I'll tell you \"Why NOT\"... we has two thin crust pizzas... and I even hate to call them that. More like... crackers with melted cheese and some toppings.  That was some of the worst excuse for pizza I've ever had. Most of the fast-food delivery pizza I've had beats it -- and I do not like at all delivery pizza.  Maybe the pan pizza is better than the thin crust... god it could not be worse!  It only deserves one star for the good service... other than that is the another sub-par overpriced \"gourmet\" pizza joint.  If you want expensive and good pizza there are many good alternatives... Pizzeria Bianco Grimaldi's etc.
pos	I absolutely love this little spot! It's a great little known boutique with incredibly unique gift items that I don't have to drive clear out to Scottsdale to find. I've been shopping at Vignettes for about 8 years. Whenever I am in a quandary about what to get someone this is the first place that I head to. Mostly it is because of the wide range of specialty items that they have on hand. Whether it's something for the garden a gift for the new bride or baby a unique piece of art or heavenly scented candles - you will not be disappointed.  The owners / staff are super friendly and have always been more than willing to help find something within a price range or based on occasion / need. And they do the most amazing wrap jobs making gift giving even easier.  The final bonus is their annual Clearance sale. For three days each year they basically blow out their stock to make way for new finds. Ask to be put on their mailing list to ensure your have a heads up and get there early because long time customers like myself never miss it. : )
neg	I recently had a shit cleaned at the Intercontinental Hotel in Hong Kong. Not cheap. I only mention that because this place charged MORE to clean that suit - almost $30 for a two-piece suit after they tacked on their $6 \"designer brand\" surcharge (no I am not kidding). Despite branding as \"green\" the suit still reeked of solvent (the green silica-based solvents have never left an odor in my experience). No differentiation to justify these absurd prices - a lot of good alternatives in the area. Be warned!
pos	Came here with a large group a while back.  We were there to eat and have a beer before a concert there. It was a weekday so we made it to happy hour. Happy Hour pricing was fair. The food was pretty good. The very best thing there is the beer!  They had like everything on tap! MMMM!
neg	Where are the managers????   It took 1 1/2 hours for our meal to come out at 8:15 in the evening.  Items came out at different times so we couldn't all eat at the same time.  The asparagus tempura was inedible because they didn't cut the ends.  Waitress just took it away and did not comp us.  Waitress knew next to nothing about the sushi menu.  She sat and talked with the hostess the entire time instead of waiting on her tables.  Food was WAY over priced and I couldn't speak to my dinner companions because the music was way to loud.  One of the worst dining experiences in a long time.  Paid $70 for a dinner for 4 and went home hungry.  HORRIBLE!
pos	Beer...or Yoga?  Located in a small center just east of Four Peaks Brewery in Tempe (a reasonable distance from the light rail on Apache) is an amazing classy studio for the Mind-Body connection.  Mr. Mustachio had decided after doing a couple yoga classes with me at the ASU gym that he loved the stretch so pursued a class for a semester at ASU this Spring and had the pleasure of practicing with Tish Hegel. After seeing his body transform to only 16.2\% body fat all his jeans get too big on him and fill out his American Apparel briefs nicely I was super jealous. He raved about his teacher and I could tell he had de-stressed a lot since he started the practice.  Luckily she opened up a studio recently and it simply goregous. The waiting area is filled with yoga material and a very calming space with a remodeled bathroom and dressing rooms to change if coming from work/school. Not at all cheesy like the SouthWest Inst with the way too many angels imagery (creepy!). But the gem is truly the practice space. Hardwood floors high ceilings a beautiful staircase tasteful decorations and absolutely NO MIRRORS.    That is right- the only person staring at my pudge rolls is my teacher and who-ever isn't focusing on their tree posture-not the entire class! It really relieves a lot of stress  and helps me concentrate on how a posture feels as opposed to just looks.  As for Tish Hegel she is simply outstanding-she has so many credentials you have to read her biography for yourself. She has been practicing for a loooong time and her hands-on instruction and confident voice echoes in my ears even now (bring those shoulders down!).   So far I have done:  Ashtanga Inspired Flow (pretty intense really hurt for 3 days would recommend after getting into yoga for a while) Sivananda (ditto)  Focus Class (did a lot of bike riding and she focused on everybody's body issues and did the sequence right then and there for us and my lower back and knees felt amazing the day after) and this morning brought my friend to Kinetic Yoga: Morning Movement and Flow which kicked our 6am asses a little bit but we both felt amazing afterwards!  She does tons of modifications is always making sure we are okay and is just super personable.  I did the huge package since I didn't renew my ASU gym membership for this summer but you can do drop-in.   Now for the cliched Yoga Review ending:   NAMASTE!
neg	Still quite poor both in service and food. maybe I made a mistake and ordered Sichuan Gong Bao ji ding for what seemed like people from canton district. Unfortunately to get the good service U have to speak Mandarin/Cantonese. I do speak a smattering but try not to use it as I never feel confident about the intonation.   The dish came out with zichini and bell peppers (what!??)  Where is the peanuts the dried fried red peppers and the large pieces of scallion. On pointing this out all I got was \" Oh you like peanuts.. ok I will put some on\" and she then proceeded to get some peanuts and sprinkle it on the chicken.  Well at that point I was happy that atleast the chicken pieces were present else she would probably end up sprinkling raw chicken pieces on it like the raw peanuts she dumped on top of the food.   Well then  I spoke a few chinese words and the scowl turned into a smile and she then became a bit more friendlier.   Unfortunately I do not condone this type of behavior. It is all in poor taste...
pos	Figured it is time to write a review after going here for quite a few years for dinner on special occasions or just to have some of the best seafood and Bone in fillet around.   First off you have to understand that the cuts are top quality so you can order almost any steak off the menus and be dazzled by the flavor which is fantastic to the point that adding anything to it would destroy the integrity of the taste as is.  I mean the meat is perfection on a plate and this needs no other explaining.  If with friends or even your significant other you must start with the the seafood tower which can be order in many different ways to match your appetite and likes. When presented at the table you and your guests will be blown away at the quality of the seafood and rightly so as it is brought in fresh daily.  The sides are too awesome in their taste and quality and i suggest the Lobster mash or the Maestros Mash potatoes neither of which will leave you hungry in their own right but often wanting more :)   Wine selection is great and the atmosphere is top notch but topping it with some of the best servers in town makes this one of my favorites for entertaining.   you will not be disappointed.
neg	First I hope La Fonda management reads these reviews and takes steps to improve their restaurant.  Second we miss the bloody mary bar too.  Hubby & I visited LF a few weeks ago on a Saturday night for dinner. We asked the waitress a general question about a beer and she made something up that was ridiculously wrong.  Okay she doesn't know beer.  We liked the chips & salsa it was a good start then I took a sip of my water.  What the?  I know what Tempe tap water tastes like but this was weird.  The aftertaste made me cringe I couldn't drink it even with a slice of lemon in it maybe it was the ice.  Hubby ordered chicken enchiladas which he orders practically everywhere and it was so bad he didn't finish it.  My meal was not memorable either.  I wanted to love this place or at least like it.  We walked out of there terribly disappointed I doubt we'll go back.
pos	I can't describe to you how amazing these gourmet adult hot pockets taste! They literally MELT in your mouth- a few of my favorites are the Cajun Chicken Dill Salmon and the Stilton & Steak---Bon Appetit everyone! And don't forget about the all day everyday-$3 car bombs(you can't beat that price) their happy hour is amazing too!
neg	I'd say I've been to the Clubhouse a few times a year over the past five years or so. Does that make me the most knowledgeable person on the venue? By all means no. But there are some very common themes among the shows I've seen here even though the artists were different genres different crowds and even different times of year.   The sound quality is terrible. The last three bands that I have seen there (and have seen in other venues as well) all complained that they couldn't get the sound right on their monitors or in the house. To me that's a major turn off if the band isn't happy with their sound are they going to be very motivated to play? Maybe it's a slighted observation but it seems that the only bands that return to this venue are the ones that play music where the sound quality isn't...let's say \"sacrificed or as important\" (metal hardcore thrasher hip-hop whatever you call it).   The venue is also hot. I don't read the reviews of others before I review a location because I don't want my opinions to be skewed but I noticed someone said \"don't wear pants\" honestly that's a really good tip. The last show I saw here was in June. I know it's Phoenix in the summer suck it up. But when you exit the venue and it is noticeably and significantly \"cooler\" than inside the venue we've got issues can they not afford to run the a/c?   The answer to that question is maybe not. The bar is understaffed and patrons seem to be lined up 3+ deep all around. Sometimes you've got to spend money to make money. Hire more bartenders customers get served faster thus allowing them more time to consume the beverage and purchase more. That means you can sell more which means you will make more money! What a concept.   Hate to just destroy a business but hopefully they will heed the feedback constructively. Until then remember: if you've always wanted to hear the artist you are going to see in a low-fi format here's your chance if you have always wanted to forgo wearing those pantaloons I support you and finally you should craft a clever way to hide a flask since you won't get served although this might be difficult sans bottoms.
pos	So very Portlandia in its hipsterness and decor. Premium coffee roasted in-house in the middle of the desert no less! Who would have thunk it.  Baristas were profesh and friendly. They even warmed up our pastries upon request. Perfectly foamed milk and fruity noted espresso. I hope this place has a long life in Scottsdale where great coffee is few and far between.
neg	Not that any SBUX is worth going out of your way for but this one is worth skipping. The service I've experienced each time I've been is pretty dang poor and the drinks always seem quite cold.
pos	Awesome subs clean and friendly well priced.
neg	How does this restaurant generate so many 4 and 5 star ratings?   I know it was on the food channel but honestly the food was sub-par. Maybe it was just an off day but I have a feeling it wasn't. The prices were not outrageous but it wasn't cheap either. The atmosphere was nice if very cafeteria like.  But the food was way way too \"greasy.\" And bland. And my stomach now aches after eating there....
pos	I LOVE Chic Nails!  I used to go to Tip & Toes on 48th street and Ray Road until one day they were \"too busy\" to take my friend and I in for pedicured. We discovered Chic Nails and have been doing all of our manicures and pedicures there since.   The staff is extremely friendly and they give the best pedicures for a very reasonable price. I highly recommend this nail salon over any other!  P.S. It is extremely close to CK's Bar & Grill to go for happy hour after! :)
neg	My wife and I live around the corner hadn't eaten here in a few months. We got food for take out Mongolian beefkung po chickenpad Thai noodles.  Mongolian beef there were more white onions then scallions and it was very bland. Kung po chickenlots of white meat chicken the whole dish only had one peanut and the taste of this dish was non existent. Very very Blah... Pad Thai noodlesthe dish was dry and came out of the container in one giant clump. It tasted like plain noodles i was glad I had peanut sauce in the fridge toadd to it. Then it was edible .... We will not be going back to G@S.. Very disappointed !!!! From now on it will be Jade palace on 92nd street. For take out Asian !!!!  Do yourself a favor go elsewhere !!!!
pos	After the Padres Spring Training game we had reservations at Don & Charlie's in Scottsdale .  None of us had been here before and it came highly recommended by my dad.  As soon as you walk into Don and Charlie's your eyes start feasting on all the signed baseballs down the left wall.  Now everywhere you look from floor to ceiling and even the ceiling itself is covered in memorabilia and autographed items from athletes of all sports and other celebrities.   Besides the amazing assortment of sports artifacts I especially like the Cactus League Beer List which pairs a beer with each city that has a team in the Cactus League.  Colorado = Coors Light  Texas =Shiner Bock Chicago =Old Style and San Diego =Stone IPA etc.  Also worth mentioning is the complimentary chopped liver platter with rye bread and bagel chips they bring as soon as you are seated.  I had the ribs with coconut shrimp combo which was great. I wasn't thrilled with the side dish: potato's au gratin which is a $2.50 upcharge.  They also bring a huge bowl of cole slaw with each entrée or you can choose soup which comes in a smaller bowl than the cole slaw!  We were too full for dessert and as we walked out this place was packed!  I found myself trying to take in as much memorabilia as possible and then on one side of the crowded lobby there sat Willie Mays himself.  He was signing his book (or a baseball) for a $200 charitable donation to his foundation. Needless to say I 'm not bringing home any memorabilia myself!
neg	There really isn't much I like about Michael's to begin with - I especially dislike them for using my name and putting on such an inferior showing - but this location was a particular disaster.  Clean up your aisles for goodness sake I feel claustrophobic with all the crap hanging around - its like the clothing section at K-Mart but possibly worse.
pos	Best food super friendly staff and great prices. Love it!
neg	oK first i broke my promise to myself and went here again i figured by now things have got to be better. i ordered something that i wouldn't care if it was cold French Toast. ok so the french toast is good. but it wasn't worth waiting 40 fucking minutes to get it. and on top of it. my friends food was cold again. one of them would rather eat glass then eat at this place so refused to order a cold meal but since my other friend was paying she said fuck it i'll go.  well she ordered toast and some sausage as sides. and my other friend ordered the mish mash his review of the place is more generious then mine but he's only been there once and said it wasn't so bad. lol.  so anyways toast soo cold the butter couldn't even melt. and cold sausage to boot. the friend with the mishmash lol. i saw the bottom of the bowl and it was all a weird watery substance at the bottom. how hard is it to drain poached eggs before dumping them in a bowl?  i was going to give palatte 3 stars based on the french toast but it was hardly warm. i so badly want to like this place cause it's close and Matt's is always packed.  can i please get a breakfast place in the roosevelt area that is large enough to seat more then 20 people and serves good breakfast?
pos	Christy is an amazing cake artist.  She has an impressive portfolio as she has a flair for creativity.  Her cakes are amazing and are truly one-of-a-kind.  She also has several delicious cake flavors to choose from or she can create one for you.   She has made several cakes for our family and I have been impressed with everyone of them.  I was also excited to see her compete on TLC's Ultimate Cake Off show early this spring.  If you're looking for a sculpted cake or one that will be the center of attention at your next party then I recommend you call Phoenix Cake Company.
neg	They have some rude employees its unbelievable. I'm trying to give business to them and ordered 6 smoothies and the cashier and her employee gave me a dirty look. Not customer friendly. At all.
pos	After driving down a teeny dimly lit road and coming across what looked like a medical office building in the 60's my husband and I found the amazing Fuego Bistro. We had a perfect meal there. Amazing ambiance twinkly lights in the courtyard live musician. Great wine. Food was so unique and delicious- I'd describe it as Southern-Spanish fusion. This meal was the highlight of our trip to Phoenix.   If you live in Phoenix you have no excuse to not come here. I live in Chicago and I'm sure I'll be back.
neg	I really don't get why everyone is raving this place.  I've been here twice and ordered the carne asada burrito.  The portions are really small for the price that they charge.  There is too much tortilla for the meat.  I think this place is overrated and that there are better places for carne asada in the valley.
pos	It's just like pizza bianco without the wait. This pizza is a 9.9999 and bianco is a 10. This place has a much larger menu and their deserts are to die for.   If bianco has more then a 30 min wait just drive and or walk here.
neg	I have had it with the meat department at Whole Foods Market on Scottsdale Rd & the Mayo Blvd. They really suck.  I gave them another chance (out of desperation really) and they blew it!  I am so disappointed.  I purchased some turkey breasts there (3 of them) at around $30.00 for a 4 lb breast. I came home froze two and cooked one. It smelled but my husband insisted that it was the smoked smell of being in the butcher case with all the other meats.  I trusted his opinion and cooked it. Upon slicing it up for dinner I found that the free range turkey was very fatty. It was gross but no one got sick luckily.  Well now I just thawed out another one and the same thing but worse. It stinks like the rotting dead animal it is. It is definitely bad.  And it gets even worse! As I inspected it and opened up the two breasts (Whole Foods puts two breast together with a net to make one large one) I pulled out about 8 inches of thick fatty I don't even know what from it. Let's just say it definitely LOOKS like the dead animal it is too. What ever that stuff is it is all gray and rotten.  They are basically stuffing their Turkey Breasts with junk to make more money. I have had it with them!   I am not surprised. They have always been trouble. Frank the manager there is really not the kind of guy one would trust with food. His is kind of creepy and gives off a dirty \"I don't care\" attitude.  I spent over $100.00 there on Turkey (ground & whole) and he (Frank) still charged me for the breast bones - and another employee told me that they usually just throw them in the trash!  The meats at this butcher department cannot be trusted. The manager there cannot be trusted and has failed every time. It is really gross; top dollar for top trash! My husband thinks the manager is getting some sort of incentive for selling the \"questionable meat\" instead of throwing it out!    I am still nauseous from the smell sight and from touching all that gray rotting gross stuff. BLEECH!!! I think I ate that in the last one!
pos	As mentioned earlier the best thing about this place is the super cheap but super delicious lunch bentos.  You get a main dish rice salad and an orange for under $4. If that's not enough you can get double meat for a buck or two more.  I highly recommend the ginger pork or the katsu.  My friend I normally go with is a big fan of the white fish (fried or grilled).  The sushi here isn't bad.  It's nothing super special but I don't come here for the sushi so it's not a big knock against the place.  As they would say on ebay: A+++ Great Seller! Would eat here again!!!
neg	just say no.  this place is truly awful.  too bad it's taking up valuable space on monroe.
pos	'twas the night before booyah and all the through the city people were piecing  some pretty shitty costumes together at savers good will george w bush clintons bill and hill jay-z & beyonce biden and obama even saw kanye oprah super mamma yep octomom brad pitt & jolie and men as madonna and lynn sue cooney  i went to Easley's to see what they had of course it was madness every kid mom and dad crammed into the isles pulling on wigs vampire masks and noises of pigs all being assisted  by the yellow tee'd staff so very helpful no panic just laughs \"yes we have liberace in fact we have two try both of them on i'll grab 'em for you\" they found me a boa a wig and make up took just fifteen minutes case opened and shut and all around me this repeated itself the people rolled in pleased people rolled out into the darkness parties around town wonder how many were out gettin' down in get ups from Easley's i'm guessing a ton so check out Bert Easley's make up magic fun bright yellow building south side of mcdowell since nineteen sixty four makin' halloween howl
neg	Food middle of the road... The staff is rude.. Seems like it starts with the owner. I think she makes the staff pay for everything that goes wrong so in turn they dont want to fix issues with poor wrong food etc.  I think she tends to forget the customers are actually what keeps a business open. For a long time it was the only choice in the area. Now there are multiple choices.  If your in the area Chili's or Connolys is much better choice in my oppinion.
pos	Took my fiance' there for Valentine's day/ Birthday.  I did a lot of research of romantic places around the Valley and this one really caught my eye.  Immediately after walking through the door you'll notice a dark and romantic ambiance with a lot of candle light.  Seating is a bit tight but it wasn't bad enough for me to give it a lower review.  We began with an appetizer called \"Table side guacamole\" which was incredible to say the least.  It literally is made in front of your table.  Then it was onto the main dish... Build-your-own  Pork tacos.  Talk about tender meat!!  The shoulder of pork literally fell right off onto the fork.  The tortillas were exceptional and so was the tasty sauce which included pineapple glaze.  So the food was absolutely delicious...but the service was equally impressive.  My water level never reached the bottom of the glass the entire night and I drink plenty!  Everyone was incredibly nice and cheerfully said \"Happy Valentine's Day!\" and \"Happy Birthday!\" to my fiance' which made the experience even better.  A fantastic place that I'll have no problem recommending to others to visit!
neg	If there was a way I could give this restaurant NO stars I might have.  The chips and salsa are the ONLY thing that requires a star here.  The service was less than average the food was hotter than the surface of the sun and the drinks were teeny tiny (and didn't much taste like alcohol).  My husband ordered a green chile dish and it came smothered in red sauce when he asked the waiter if it looked green or red the server said \"nope that's what green looks like\".  WOW!  Sorry but I don't think I will be returning.
pos	I have had a great experience every time I have been there.  The food is hard to beat and the service was pleasant.    Portions are reasonable not huge (I'm a big feller) and I was satified every time I ate there.    Very pleasant environment clean spacious and calm.
neg	One stop has one goal and that is to get the $80. diagnosis fee and split.  Francisco told me i needed to spend over $1300. for parts the manufacturer only charges $316 for. Stay away! I intend to file a complaint with the Attorney Generals office today hopefully they will stop this nonsense.
pos	I love this restaurant!! I have been a fan of the Newport Beach location for years. Scottsdale definitely did not disappoint! The staff is friendly and knowledgeable. The drinks are fresh (worth the extra wait for the tasty Cucumber Jalapeño marg). And the food? Goes without saying it's CRAVE worthy. This is a new location so I expected the usual growing pains. But overall a great dining experience. Welcome to the neighborhood SOL Cocina!
neg	this another place that i would give no stars to if possible.  it's been on the corner of mill and university for as long as i can remember which is impressive since nothing older than ten years has been able to withstand the rent increases and even more impressive because i don't know a single person who goes there.  i went in there one time for drinks and walked past one of the foulest salad bars I've ever seen. for some reason it's right by the door. instead of walking in to see a hostess stand you walk right into this brown mess of vegetables.  after seeing that first off i wouldn't dream of ordering food here. the place is also dark and dirty and there's never anyone inside of it.  seriously I'm really curious how this place survives. awesome little neighborhood wing and live music joints like long Wong's get torn down for high rise condos yet gross ghost town ruby Tuesdays hangs on the corner of main and main of Tempe. what is wrong with the world?
pos	That darn Smokehouse burger is awesome. 5 stars.   The smoked corn was a little Meh... it was oily like not butter oily... not a huge fan of the texture either. I like corn crunchy and it was not.   Service was great.   I did see an unmentionable bug running around near the back entrance towards the chicken rotisserie thing but bugs have to eat too right? (still 5 stars lol)
neg	1 star for service but the food is not ok :( they literally put 4 pieces of chicken on my taco. I let that go & figured was a mistake. When I went again ordered different item & same result. Little to no meat. I will not be going back.
pos	Very friendly and knowledgeable guys.
neg	I was here for a conference and saw their sign for a $10 lunch special which wasn't available that day.  Took over an hour to just get a lunch salad.  The waiter had major attitude. Avoid this place!
pos	I have been here several times now and have never had a bad experience yet.  Good food good service; no complaints.   Still have never made it here for happy hour but their specials during that time seem like quite a deal.  The staff are always friendly and seem to remember us from one visit to another.  I've only ever eaten sushi here but they have a lot of other menu items that I would like to try at some point but I always turn to the sushi as it has always been good and fresh.  I would recommend trying this restaurant.
neg	My family and I ate here just a few days ago. It was an experience that left me yearning for more out of a restaurant I have seen so crowded over the years and decided to try with a group of 7 of us in the family. First off we got there at 10 am and were missing only two in our party so we had to wait to be seated which was fine. Once the rest of our party showed up at 10:07 we were not seated until after 10:30. When we were seated we were all scrunched together at a medium sized table that would comfortable seat 5 adults. Well there were 7 of us total and needless to say it was very tight! The waitress stated that we could take our water and go wait back up front for a bigger table but we were looking at roughly 40 minutes of waiting again!!! Seriously? We ordered drinks first and the waitress brought my father his tomato juice and almost spilled it on him but instead spilled it all over her hand. Then she sat the glass down in front of him with juice on table and all over glass and left! She never came back with a wet towel to clean up her mess!! We all ordered and the food arrived quickly. This was the only part of the experience that was good sadly to say. We received our food order for 7 of us within 15-20 minutes which was excellent. My uncle and grandmother both had charred toast (it was black not just black around the edges) . The bacon looked like dried strips of hard leather. Overall none of us will be returning to this place! It was is so overrated. We are headed back to RANDY'S here in Scottsdale to do our next family breakfast.
pos	I'm from Chicago so I'm picky with my pizza--this place does it right (NY style)! I love the \"hole in the wall\" feel. Every customer that walked in was a regular which was a good sign. I ordered the Mozzarella sticks and a large Monster Pie (Sausage pepperoni bell peppers onion and cheese). The mozzarella sticks took a little while to come out but they were cooked to perfection. They also threw in a few garlic knots which was awesome. The pizza was unbelievable--I think the crumbled sausage really did it! They have great deals like large pie & 20 wings for $20 which I definitely will be taking advantage of during football games on Sunday. Glad to have found a new place where I can also be a regular!
neg	I was severely mislead by Frank A's \"It's hot but the food ain't bad.\" review.  It was very cold and by far the worst food I've ever eaten.  You would have to drag me here in cuffs to get me to return.
pos	Perhaps it was foolish for me to give La Condesa only four stars at first given the fact that I really liked it.  What can I say?  I'm critical by nature.  I knew I was going back soon so I felt like I had to save the last for a return visit.  Well it just got it.  This place is fantastic.  In fact if CenPho lets this one go under I will personally hold all of you responsible; watch out for a citizen's arrest if I ever see you.  However that is unlikely to happen because the food is damn tasty.    Today the Oaxaca black mole chicken taco had me swooning topped with pickled onions; the chicken is tender and simmered in the lovely sauce.  The Soronan carne asada taco char-grilled over mesquite charcoal is no slouch either; I'd rate it right up there with some of my favorites in town.    Go to this place; I have a feeling I'll be here at least weekly.  When and if they ever get a beer/liquor license...probably more.
neg	Would have to agree with Rana A below... I think she said it best  Actually I had several folks tell me this place was lousy before I went... it even fell below my already low expectations...  Given that I just left the real Barcelona (in Spain)- part of me was truly crying inside that night. OK I gotta admit- everytime I tell someone I was just in Barcelona (the city) and they say \"you mean the one in Scottsdale\" there is a part of me that wants to just pack my bags and fly back...
pos	Great place for brunch or to relax with a coffee. Their hot chocolate is amazing.
neg	when i worked in retail my paycheck was spent before i got paid. therefore i relied heavily on coupons and splitting meals w all of my other poor college friends.  well i hit the jackpot. $15 coupon for a FEAST. the picture on the coupon showed everything we would get: a huge steak shrimp and lobster PLUS 2 sides. there were 3 of us- this was PLENTY.   it was prom night too so we were initally fooled with how popular it was. popular for prom girls with light up clear shoes (not even lying) if that says anything about the crowd for you...  our waitress stops by our booth and just stares at us. one of my friend kinda looks around at me and our other friend then back at the waitress. 'ill have a diet coke?'  then our waitress writes it down and doesn't say anything but looks at my other friend.  i lost it and started laughing. why isn't she talking to us? this is so weird.   we ended up asking for a different waitress then found out the coupon was a big fat liar. you didn't get all of that. it just says you do but you don't. the food ended up being nasty. probably one of the worst meals ive ever had.   as we're leaving susy talks a lot waitress trips over my friend and it was all too awkward bc i couldn't control laughing.   awful food awful service AND the bathrooms were some of the grossest i had ever been in.   if wal-mart ran a restaurant this would be it.
pos	Hands down the best breakfast I've ever had anywhere. It definitely feels like home cooked breakfast. I've never been to this place on the weekend when it isn't packed out the door. I'm not the only person that loves this place!
neg	HELLISH HELLISH SUMMER WEATHER (March thru October) it hurts my lungs to breath.  I couldn't get transcripts because I had a parking ticket I needed to pay. The problem is... *i DON'T OWN A CAR I don't drive I don't even have a drivers license*!! ~*~*-- aside from that one minor incident~*~*  I paid 9000 USD a semester to receive a so and so education. I graduated with a magna cum laude. I have attended other universities. However I couldn't help but notice the gap in the quality and variety of classes offered.  For example you have to be a finance major to take upper level interesting finance classes.  Business school was so and so a lot of repetition. Very little hands-on and help with internships. Way too much groupwork and free-riding. They do not have many good employers at their semi annual recruiting events.  Oh and professors rarely teach the courses. They have their teaching assistants teach us.  Also there is a lack of bridging classes between lower level and upper level classes.  Junior year when you get admitted into the \"professional program\" the level of the classes and transition isn't too smooth.  The campus tutoring program is pretty helpful for general classes if you're having trouble with classes (usually lower level)  There are not enough chairs/desks in some classes. The students sit on the floor and cram on the stairs in the lecture halls.  Also the classes don't teach you how to think critically which I think is crucial in college. Please don't waste your money especially those of you from out of state. Its not worth it.  Expect to wait in line wherever you go. ASU accepts way too many people. It would prolly accept my cat and my baby sister who barely talks if we threw money at them.  Thus its very difficult to get myself into the classes I need. The advisors are walking advertisements of the business school. They are not informed enough to advise you.  I got dropped from two required prerequisite courses so I could not move on to the next level.... even after pre-registration. I got screwed and ended up having to take one more semester to graduate.  Tuition rose from 6000 a semester in Fall of 2003 to 9000 + in Fall of 2007. Gross!!  One thing I liked was the student theatre performances. The admission $ was reasonable and quite entertaining.  The College of Architecture and Environmental design studios are pretty good and has good security.  ASU is not the most safe neighborhood. I have been approached by many shady people.  do NOT live on campus. Especially the dorms on north campus. They are beyond crappy and overpriced. You have to split your room with a room mate in most cases for undergrads. The \"freshman year experience\" bullsh*t they pull on you don't buy it. and Please PLEASE please don't move into Manzy Hall (Manzanita; 15 stores with triangular windows).  I lived here my froshy year and its the dirtiest (rats) unhealthy (mold pot circulation) most promiscuous place on campus.  Again please don't bother wasting your money especially if your an out of state or international student.  Hope this helps.
pos	This place is fantastic!  We went in on Sunday the 29th of July around 5:00pm. The guy behind the counter told us to enjoy ourselves take our time ask if we had any questions. We wandered around for a bit I found a bottle of Argyle bubbly that I wanted and then began to stare with lust in my eyes at the selection of Absinthe.   Girlfriend wandered over to ask the guy to recommend a white that wasn't a Chard as we both really don't like buttery oak anything. He took a few cues from her and found a great bottle of white which we drank with great glee last night.   This was a test for the guy behind the counter. She didn't set a price limit just said \"show me your favorite.\" He could have done what many others have in the past and shown us a $50 bottle but instead he showed us a kick ass bottle at the $14 price point. This is the mark of a good wine seller. Find you what you want without bending you over on the price. Yes sometimes I want to spend $400 a bottle but not all that often. I'd rather get my drink on at the price he found and he turned us onto a white we both REALLY liked which is super rare as we have very different tastes.  We'll absolutely be going back to buy more fermented grape from this place!  Prices are on par with Total Wine but what you're really paying for is the help of someone who knows what they sell and likes their job. Great job Sportsman's see you next Sunday for afternoon drinking!
neg	Tried to get ahold of this dude to no avail. No personal message on his answering machine at all. Website sucks for information to let me know what sorta work or quality thereof he does. I tried to call here @ 6:53pm tonight and again...no one picks up the phone. So fed up with flaky contractors. Do they want work or not?
pos	Recently moved back to Mesa I have been on the hunt for a place to get a good sandwich and fresh bread. This place now tops my list of places in the East Valley to get a good sandwich. My first sandwich was the Atlantic Haddock Provencal. A sandwich made with seared lightly breaded haddock sliced hard-boiled egg fresh basil romaine lettuce tomato Provencal tartar sauce on a grilled Brioche roll. The brioche was amazing. It was light and fluffy. The haddock was perfectly cooked with just the right amount of breading and the vegetables were fresh and in perfect proportions as to not overpower the bread and haddock. Sometimes when you go to a sandwich shop they overload it with everything else that the meat and bread are just there to accessorize the vegetables and sauce. This was perfectly done. The atmosphere is pleasant and open with nice music as the light smell of fresh bread in the background salivates me. This is a must-visit lunch time destination. Dinner review shortly.
neg	food is ok but service is very slow!
pos	What a wonderful night. It didn't start out that way. I found this restaurant on yelp not realizing that it was sixteen miles from the hotel my wife and i were staying at. I heard the grief all the way there. \"Come on honey it's an adventure!\".   We arrived and were greeted warmly and shown right to our table. Zach our waiter was right there to offer us drinks and appetizers. We had the Summer Rolls and they were delicious!   I explained to  Zach that I was allergic to wheat and he brought us a special \"gluten free\" menu the owner had created for those of us who are allergic to wheat. Zach even brought us some special wheat-free dipping sauce for the Summer rolls. He showed great care provided great customer service  and the sauce  was delicious!  The portions were good sized and the presentation was beautiful. But the wonderful tastes and personal service made the night special. Oh the bathrooms were clean too. Thanks Zach and thanks Malee's. It was a great night my wife and I look forward to repeating. (Yes she admitted after dinner that the drive was worth it.)
neg	Have the owners from here ever even had a bagel from back east? Certainly doesn't taste like it and they charge double what they do back east too. No thanks. The search for a good bagel continues for now I'll just keep having them shipped straight from NJ.
pos	I am a way more frequent visitor of the bell rd location but sometimes I have to travel downtown for work. When I do I make my route pass by this place because I have to have dutch bros.  The guys at the bell location are pretty familiar with me by now but these guys still treat you as if you are there best customer. And it's the best coffee I've ever had.
neg	We went here for Mother's Day based on the positive reviews and had a pleasant experience.  Good food good service good ambiance.  We came back here for Father's Day and had a very unpleasant experience; the worst display of management I have ever encountered!  Apparently our order was never put in from the server or there was some sort of \"computer malfunction' they claimed but we waited at the table for 45 minutes after ordering no food nothing.  The server obviously recognized the mistake and kept checking in with us and apologized for the unusually long wait (did I mention the restaurant was half empty I wonder why!) and she did offer to comp our coffee drinks.  But the infuriating part was when we finally complained to the manager because we could not figure out why the ridiculously long wait she came over to our table did not properly introduce herself sat down and pointed to the man-held computer system and TOLD US we had only been waiting 15 minutes.  Really?!?  You're coming over to tell us how long we have been waiting???  It was so rude and disrespectful she was trying to argue her point to us which clearly showed that the server did not put in our order immediately which is probably why the server apologized to us umpteen times!!!  It was the most ridiculous display of what NOT to do as a manager.  I have been in management and customer service for over 12 years and this was clearly a Management 101 mistake.  She never apologized or tried to rectify the situation but when you come out to your customers in fighting mode you really cannot rectify that!    Needless to say unless this restaurant starts to provide better training to their managers and team members or hires a new manager we will NOT be coming back here again.
pos	Even more great news....on Tuesdays there is a special of 35c per ounce. Not that I needed another incentive...but this is GREAT.
neg	I never got a chance to try the food because I was so turned off by the way I was treated. My family and I will be waiting for a table across the parking lot at The Cheesecake Factory.
pos	Where to begin?  This is my favorite Mexican food establishment ever. I've been frequenting Carolina's for years and never once have I been disappointed. Some might compare it to Filiberto's or any of those [insert surname here]berto's but this is on a whole different level.  Atmosphere-wise it's one step above a sketchy hole-in-the-wall but the food makes up for everything the appearance of the place lacks. I don't know their secret but their beans the tortillas the salsa... it's all to die for. And IT'S. SO. CHEAP. Like seriously I'd dish out more money for this food but the fact that it really is that cheap is the icing on the cake.   It's almost always busy but it's always worth the wait. Always.  If you haven't gone... you're missing out.
neg	Here's the 1. 2. 3...  1. Great Food. I love hot New Mexico style food. Good job. 2. They have a little brewery and make 3 house beers. Unfortunately they're all shitty. 3. They could REALLY improve the service. No Bueno!   We'll be back for the food. It might be take out next time though!  4-17-11 Update: Some asshole who was clearly affiliated with Arribas contacted me via private message to slam me for my review. I hope the yelp police find you and pull you off the site. More importantly I hope more people read my review and stay away from this restaurant. Good Food folks just get it to go! To Bryan L. and the rest of the gang over at Arribas....Go EFF yourselves! You get one star and NO more of my money!!!!!!! Learn how to work Kid!
pos	I just got back from an Arizona spring training vacation and one of the highlights was definitely the Desert Botanical Gardens.  We came really close to skipping on a visit altogether because it was 5:00pm but decided to give it a shot...it was worth it!  I was a little disappointed that the Butterfly Pavillion had closed for the day at 5:00pm and several walking areas were being used for weddings/receptions (who could blame these people??) but still got to see a lot of beautiful desert plants and wildlife.  We managed to get in for free not sure if it was because of the time of the day or all the people just walking in for the weddings though which totally made the park that much more fun.  I am not sure I would have gotten as much enjoyment out of it if I'd had to pay $5 to get in...  The little desert rat-sqirrels and rabbits were totally fun to try to find hiding in the many different plants and burrows.  I felt like a little kid ooh-ing and ah-ing at the different varieties of cacti and desert wildflowers and have to give this place the ultimate rating .  If you're ever in Arizona please give this place a try it's very well put together and a beautiful site to see.
neg	My husband and I have Been meaning to go in here and see if it was anything like hong kong gourmet so yesterday for lunch we decided to give it a try. Huge mistake! The food was literally inedible everything was either too cold or burnt to a char nothing tasted good. We decided to try the desert and the cream puff (I'm unsure how you can mess that up) was petrified and the cream was so gross I spit it out. The smell of the flan actually made us gag we had such an awful time I complained to the manager. She didn't even seem to care and gave us 20\% off of a lunch we didn't even eat. We were disgusted by this place and we will never ever go back. Don't do it you will regret it!
pos	Being Indian and having grown up in London I have been pretty spoilt for Indian food. Imagine my dismay when I moved to Phoenix! I've tried many different places here in town desperately trying to recapture the memory of a good London curry house but each time I've left either disappointed or clutching my guts fearing what may come.  Couple of friends introduced me to this place a few months ago and I'm stoked. It's not as good as the stuff back home. And I'm sure you can get better in San Francisco or New York. But if you are looking for something closer to home you can't go wrong.  Plus its got the real live Indians eating in there too. Can't be bad!!
neg	Service was horrible and food was mediocre at best~ won't be going back
pos	Gaylee is great! She is super sweet and so professional! Her work is amazing. I found her through one of those online deals and now I am convinced that I will never go elsewhere. Keep up the great work!
neg	Refused to call me a cab because I had a phone.
pos	The praise and worship with Pastor BJ just sets up a God Filled service with the charismatic and awesome Pastor Maiden ... Going the Past 18 months has made our Marriage Stronger and Faith Magical
neg	I waited 45min and ended up with a tiny gross little serving of tortilla with vegetable scraps thrown in it served in a aluminum take-out box. The tables are folding tables like the kind you play beer pong on. And they have pictures of kids and babies on the walls and signs asking people to send in pictures of their kids for the walls too which has nothing to do with Asian/Mexican cuisine it creeped me out.
pos	I come here probably at least once a week. The prices are right there's a good variety of \"ethnic\" food the cashiers are quick and friendly and they're just helpful. I locked myself out of my car when having a space-cadet moment and they let me use their phone to call AAA to bail me out.   Fresh flowers + great selection of wine and cheese + all the essentials   They deal is that they cut out the middle man to get great prices for quality products and they don't have sales because they always sell their products at the best price possible. =) GO TJ'S!
neg	Totally dissapointed.  I had purchased a coupon from TravelZoo to try out this restaurant which given its location I would have thought it was going to be very upscale and we were expecting a WHOLE LOT MORE.   The Service was great but the food not worth it.  The restaurant itself is very outdated very 80's.   My husband and I had the crab cakes for appertizer.  They were cold when they were served.  We told our waiter who in turn told the chef and the message was passed back to us that she appologized.    My Husband ordred a 12oz New York Strip ala carte for $29.95 6 oz of that was pure fat!  and for the price you would expect to get more meat than fat!  I ordered a wild mushroom pizza which was OK.   This place needs an over haul in a major way if they want to make any money at the restaurant which for a Saturday night at 7pm when we went was empty.  I think the highlight of the meal was the bottle of cabinet!
pos	I have only gotten the cafe sua da (iced coffee) here but it's the best I have had yet. When you walk in there is always fresh coffee lined up in cups on the counter ready to be mixed with sweetened condensed milk. I don't get to Mesa often but when I do I go here for the wonderful rich dark and creamy coffee. This is strong stuff; that first sip is so good. The richness full flavor creamy caramel flavors are heavenly.  And as the ice melts it mellows out the flavor a little and it's still great. I can't say I have had all the cafe sua da in the valley but what I have had; this is my favorite.   Next time I come to Mesa for work I will need to come at lunch time so I can try the pho.
neg	This store is banking on the hope they are the only place to buy what they are selling. The mgr at the cash register was not only snobbish and unhelpful but down right rude. It is 12/21/12 I know Christmas time is tough for retail employees but I was at many other retail stores today and their mgrs and employees were extremely friendly. I spend approx 1/2 hour talking to a sales assoc who was very friendly and all was good until I got to register with the mgr and I ended up walking out without purchasing anything. I then went to my car and purchased desired items on amazon while in this stores.parking lot. I know business is good this time of year and maybe this companies business is always good. But the post office and Sears also used to be the king! I could explain all the facts of the situation but I am sure it would make no difference as I am confident this is the culture of this store.
pos	Hippies scare me.     So in my preparation to go to this place I ordered Xanax from an on-line Canadian pharmacy which I have been taking for three days now.  Bought a tazer from Spy Headquarters in case one of them tries to hold me down and pours patchouli oil on me.  The fifth of gin that I slammed in the parking lot really helped with that last bit of extra courage that I needed to partake my journey into hippie-land.  It was all for nothing. No hippies around just a teenager behind the counter.  This place is tiny and the counters are about at mouth level. I don't know how anyone under 7'6\" could easily eat off of them.    Anyways for $5 flat you get a kick ass burger a school lunch bag half full of well seasoned skin-on fries and a can of soda.   It's true that the fries could have been a bit more crispy but they tasted so good I got over it real quick.  I'd be afraid to ask what the special ingredient is because they might say \"it's organic don't panic\".    Jerry's dead but this place lives on.  Thanks hippies!
neg	I was so happy to see another station in the neighborhood.  I went in to fill up as I usually do at any station unaware that I was paying TEN CENTS MORE PER GALLON (than Circle K)  because I wasn't paying cash or using a Shell credit card.  Yes there are signs on the pump but really who would think to look for such a requirement?  I've been buying gas for over 40'years and have never seen such a non-cash penalty.  I and my children their spouses and our friends will not be getting gas there ever again.  How disappointing and dishonest.
pos	Man do I LOVE a restaurant with REALLY GOOD food and friendly service! Liberty Market is definitely that!   Funny thing is that I was originally going to eat at Joe's Farm Grill but ended up here (after a search here on YELP).  Nice laid back decor too.  You wait in line to place your order pay and they give you a stand with a number on it (like at Sizzler) then someone brings your order.  I like places that spend the time to make their own salad dressings and take care with creating a delicious salad. The Italia was DELICIOUS and a perfect size! The homemade Minestrone soup was loaded with fresh ingredients and was REALLY fantastic too!  I forgot to try one of their desserts...the last Red Velvet cupcake was ALMOST snatched up by another customer but the Food Server was so kind to offer to get it to me (maybe I had a look of panic on my face??)...WOW!! This service is rare to find!  The restrooms are quite amusing! Saw a similar set-up in NYC. Each toilet/water-closet is individual...no stalls. They were VERY CLEAN too (ok I was seriously apprehensive that it might smell like a men's restroom since it was all unisex...no worries!!!!)  I can't wait to visit here again...but after I check out their other place across the street: Joe's Real BBQ. YUM!
neg	not clean worst gel manicure ever and ruined my nails--Jimmy finished it --his wife started it.  Nails sanded too thin and they talk to other people and look away while they'e filing sanding and cutting.  They cut two times now into the side of my thumb nail which causes it to catch and tear off the same day or soon.  Their 10 or 12-yr old daughter brought the colors to pick (she is much too precocous to be customer focused--she's narcisstic and I want an adult waiting on me).  They have to open bottles to look at gel color--no samples.  Gel drying machine is sitting on a priority mail box on top of chair in customer wait area.   Pedicure okay.  Won't come back.  This place like many with Vietnamese want your money they don't understand service (or cleanliness in this one) and why we really come to these places.  They also try and nickle and dime you on price for instance give you a deal to take off gel from previous manicure when you're getting a new gel manicure.  They want to use the dremel to sand your nails down to the quick.  How about healthy nails and return visit.  This place I'm surprised stays in business.  Sadly it's not in a category by itself although the others are cleaner.  Jimmy should stay away from nails and customers and just keep quiet.  The girl might be cute to some customers but I am not coming to have a 12-year old wait on me.  No thank you.
pos	Great experience from start to finish.  Host (who was the owner) seated us at a table with a view.  Was given house made foccacia bread and olive oil.  Was awesome.  Some of the best bread I've ever had before a meal.  The olive oil was seasoned perfectly too.  My grandma got the burger and I got the pesto penne primavera.  The pasta came with shrimp squash and some other vegetables.  I love pesto so this hit the spot.  Good serving size but not too much.  The food tasted fresh.  They make their own pasta which was delicious.  The burger was huge.  Looked like you get your moneys worth.  The ice tea was even good.  The place was clean and sleek.  They played good music and the service was perfect.  It has been a while since I had such a good overall experience with no complaints.  I will be coming back.  The host who we later found out was the owner was working that night and asked us how we liked everything.  I've said it before but that is a rare and good touch for any restaurant.  Well done.
neg	Bad customer service!    No one at the front desk for thirty minutes.  Plus they left the phone on the counter so when I tried to call their number phone just kept ringing and ringing.  :(
pos	Great customer service competitive rates and I always get a call right back from Jeff! Nice to have an agent who actually cares about his customers. I would recommend giving him a call.
neg	What's with the cheese?  It isn't even Velveta.  It's liquid cheese food and it belongs somewhere other than on my burger.  $5 burger and fries is a great deal IF -- IF -- it's a great deal.  This is just liquid cheese food on a hamburger patty.  McDonald's will do a burger and fries for $5 that's tastier than this dump.
pos	We went to The Farm today for lunch to enjoy a picnic on such an awesome beautiful day. I had the Tuscan sandwich and it was awesome. I had expected it to be good but was surprised at just how enjoyable it really was. I'm sure sitting outside in beautiful surroundings on a perfect day helped with the experience. This is the prefect place for lunch on a beautiful day. My date was equally impressed so I'm sure I will be back!
neg	The organization is grand with a ton of selection but the employees could care less about costumer service.   It is very amazing with the amount of unemployed people in the city they have to hire the most incompetent individuals....   I'm not going to be ignorant and say they are ALL bad but a few in the bunch seem to make it difficult to be a repeat costumer.   Try talking to a manager at this location and you will be routed around the store till you finally get some one that states \"the manager is off till next week.\"   i will stay a website purchaser until they change their policy at this location and hire individuals with a better standard
pos	Screw Disneyland- Sephora is the happiest place on earth!  They have everything a girly girl or a girly guy could possibly dream of and then some! They have all the best brands in cosmetics skin care and perfume and they're always adding new items to their extensive product selection.  To me getting a gift card to Sephora is like having Christmas morning over and over again.  Everywhere you look there are sparkly blushes lip plumping glosses lash-extending mascaras and anti-aging face creams- what more could anyone ask for? I can understand why men might hate going into Sephora- but they do have some products for guys too- although not many.  As far as I know Scottsdale Fashion Square is home to the only Sephora in Scottsdale but even as great as it is it still can't beat the one right on the strip in Vegas.  They're open really late and you can shop with a drink in your hand- what could be better than that?
neg	This is my very first review and I can't say I feel bad for what I am about to write. I took everyones review hoping for a really good hotdog and onion rings like the reviews I read (best hot dog ever amazing hotdog. etc) oh man were we disappointed.  I'd have to say I'd go to cocstco for a hotdog for $1.50 with a drink.
pos	I loved this little slice of heaven.  Reasonable prices tiny dining room very personal service.  Pablo was laid back but with only 4 couples in the small establishment he did a great job of making sure we were taken care of.
neg	I went today to meet my daughter for lunch.  We are both big sushi enthusiasts.  The interior and atmosphere was beautiful.  Well appointed. The service was excellent.  We ordered edamame was good...nothing to rave about.  Not much you can do to mess that up.  Drinks were well poured but exspensive for what you got.  Ordered five different sushi rolls. All five were bland not much flavor and stale.  The fish was not fresh. Paid $12 for a soft shell crap roll and it tasted days old.  Will not go back. Did here they have good pizza and a happy hour at three.  My daughter says to give it another try.  We'll see... I'll let you know if I do.
pos	AZ-88 is at once chic urban fun and just enough Scottsdale without making me want to stab myself in the face as a t-shirt-and-jeans-wearing overweight guy.  You'll first notice the atmosphere and with good reason--it's perfectly lit with noticeable but not mind-numbingly blaring music and even better they have a live DJ who goes through no small trouble to beat match and keep things rolling throughout your Wednesday-Saturday evening dining experience. When I first hit AZ-88 it had an enormous deconstructed NY taxicab suspended from the ceiling which was a fantastical conversation piece. The wall behind the bar was completely covered in names and numbers. (I was far too proud when I accurately guessed that they were the names of cabbies and the numbers were their license numbers.) Overall a very different fun look.  Comfortable chairs and very full cocktails abound and while they typically have a rock-steady delivery more than a little cosmo has ended up in my friend's purse to her chagrin. That aside the food is fantastic and even though it's a bit hard to get out of here for under $30 per person (because you simply must try the cheesecake and drinks are pushing $14) it's worth it as a classy-but-casual night out that you can really enjoy.  They have a great patio the burger is dripping with flavor (and in fact cheese) and they have waffle fries with pretty much everything. Great salads and sandwiches help round things out and they ship their cheesecake in from Carnegie Deli in New York which is just about the most perfect cheesecake you'll have the good chance to try. Forget that Cheesecake Factory nonsense these people know how a cheesecake is done. It is rich thick with just a hint of sour and an amazing flavor that takes your tongue hostage and demands whipped cream ransom.  Overall a wonderful place for drinks and good food with friends and the staff is pointed but efficient and will throw back any shit you give them in good humor or as appropriate not. (We've never run afoul of that rule but you wouldn't want to I assure you.)
neg	35 minutes... No food. You be the judge.
pos	Fun with caps if I did that sort of thing. The whole experience was great (you won't get any specifics this review is 3 weeks after I can't remember sorry). Service was by that waitress who does everything perfectly. Explain food wine doesn't stay too long. Nice interesting big room decor. Looking forward to the next time.
neg	I am not a fan of this place. I like to try to stay positive though so here is my attempt a the proverbial \"positive sandwich\"  Top Bun: The location is fantastic. I really like where it is its a cute little place that is very easy to find.  The Meat of the Matter: The food here is odd. I am very open to trying new things and experiencing different cultures. As I have mentioned in other reviews I love all types of food from all over the world. I didn't care for this place. I ordered an appetizer that was wrapped in a banana leaf and i honestly thought I was eating an ashtray. It wasn't good. The pad thai that I sampled was very lifeless. I had a friend get a big bowl of soup that looked good but i didn't try it.   Lettuce onions pickles tomato: The service was not good. I sat at the bar the first time I went here and we got ignored for the most part. The bartender (who i believe doesn't work there anymore luckily) sniffed at me when I asked for clarification on something. There are also jars of really weird floating things at the bar (probably pickled/preserved veggies/meat/fruits etc.) it was unappetizing to be around....I don't have a weak stomach at all it was just odd. The second time I went in the service was equally as bad. there was a table of 8 of us for lunch and the place was mostly dead and I had to go up and ask them to take our order after we sat waiting for 30 minutes. Subsequently the menu is small and the prices are high with not much room for substitutions or changes  Bottom bun: I like the owner he is really nice and friendly. The cooks were also friendly. I like to believe that my taste buds merely didn't care for this place. I know a lot of people that have very positive things to say about this place. I will not recommend it as a personal favorite and I will quite frankly probably avoid it unless it is specifically requested by a client. I am completely fine with the concept that not everyone has to like the same things. I personally have not had a good experience with this place but I respect the fact that a majority of the reviewers for it have.
pos	Who dosen't like Cosco I love this place. The pizza is cheap and good.
neg	If it wasn't for the bad food I would go here more than once or twice a year.  The meat was dry and tough in my first entree and not edible in my second. Now when my wife drags me here to watch a movie I order a salad only. Because they do catering I have a suspicion that they serve up left over food from catered events to their restaurant customers.    The service is OK. They have a couple of generic draft beers. Everything is overpriced.  Caveat Emptor if you order an entree.
pos	A group of us from the IVAA Summit went to Zinburger last night. The food & service was great! I think we scared our poor server (Mike) but he was wonderful!
neg	This was absolutely horrible. I got the supreme pizza with the mystery meats.  I threw it in the trash. I will wait until I get to my destination to eat. Horrible!!!
pos	I love this restaurant (even though it's a chain and I can hear my brother saying it's just a \"glorified Red Lobster\").   I ordered the Crab and Lobster Bisque soup and am drooling thinking about how much I wish I could eat it right now. For my entree I ordered the Atlantic Salmon (stuffed with crab shrimp and brie cheese) which was unbelievably amazing. I also had some scalloped potatoes which was basically in the shape of a brick covered with cheesy goodness. I wanted to eat the apple pie for dessert because it looked so delicious but could barely breathe after eating all that food.   The service was outstanding although the manager stopping by the table several times throughout dinner was annoying.   I can't wait to come back here.
neg	Yeah...notsomuch.  Sprinkles is sooooooooo not worth the wait . Or the chaos. Or the hype. Or the attitude from the morons who work there. Other things that are terrible about Sprinkles include...  - The cupcakes are not that great. I ordered two. The vanilla was okay the cinnamon was dry and chalky and I really disliked it.  - This place is a disorganized mess.   - There is no rhyme or reason to any of the ordering process. My friends and I were carefully watching the ordering process and we actually think they decided to choose the dumbest and most irrational methods to take orders and dispense cupcakes. Just stupid.  - The owners must have purposely only hired people who cannot think for themselves or make decisions. No sane person could possibly work here without being like \"um...there might be a better way to do this...\"  - Also the employees were rude. Did I mention dumb?  So get this: I attempted to order a bottle of water. I told the clerk it's 100+ degrees outside I walked there and I'm realllllllly thirsty. The idiot at the counter told me \"You can order a water here but you must wait for your name to be called to receive the water and pay for it.\" I pointed out that the water was RIGHT THERE and there wasn't anyone currently paying or using the register. Couldn't she just sell me a water? She said \"NO\" and proceeded to WRITE DOWN MY ORDER (just the word \"water\") on a cupcake order slip. She then told me to stand there and wait for my name to be called so she could HAND ME THE WATER and then ring me up.  I was all sorts of thirsty and all sorts of moody that day so I got really ghetto on her ass and was all like OH HELLLLLL-TO-THE-NO!\"   I said \"It's quite simple. Just hand me the water and I will hand you money. End of discussion.\" (There are the actual words out of the mouth!)  She looked really mad and also possibly terrified of me and my 5'4\" 110 lbs of fury. Thankfully she handed me my water so I did not have to stab her. Which was good because I was waaaaaaaaay too thirsty to stab anyone.   I must be properly hydrated in order to commit crimes of passion. And I'm mad crazy passionate about my cupcakes yo.
pos	On one of my many visits to see mi amore he took me to this fantastic little pizza joint. The aesthetics of the place were overwhelmingly perfect. I believe the maximum seating capacity of the dining area is 45 yes folks 45. So the 2 1/2 hour wait was expected and very VERY worth it. The pizzas are baked to order in a classic brick house oven. The toppings arent what youd find in your local Pizza Hut either. You can choose from fresh slices of mozzarella slices of perfectly seasoned italian sausage pepperoni slices salami slices arugula fresh basil leaves tomatoes etc. Basically what Im getting at is this is beyond words delicious classic LEGIT Italian pizza. Around the dining area you will see freshly baked loaves of focaccia bread that is later served to you with extra virgin olive oil for dipping once you are seated. The smell in that place is heavenly.....incredibly reminiscent of my grandmothers kitchen!!  PS GET THERE EARLY!!
neg	I (like others) am at a loss as to why this place has such a good overall review. tasteless and awful
pos	The pizza is my favorite in Phoenix.  It is light airy and tasty and does not give you that \"I am reading to explode as my cotton mouth is making me drink two liters of water every half hour\" feeling.  The ingredients are fresh and delicious.    I am hooked!
neg	Boy is the name a temptation.Seriously :)  I'll try to be fair though but I'm writing at a time were this restaurant was truly life changing. So much so that I'm buying a dining room table additional gear for the kitchen and not frequenting any chain while I'm in my hometown based on the strength of this experience. Even in a good mood this place wouldn't be breaking a 2.5 . I'm not in a good mood.    Texas cheese fries. Pretty tastelessmess of uncrisp steak fries that are meant to be Monterrey jack  cheddar and bacon. Either the cheese mixed itself together really well or that's not what I had. Bacon  mm that is a very generous term for the toe nail clippings of meat that ended up atop it. Saving grace was only ordering 1/2 an order.  Kid's meal.  Holy crap dried and scraggly carrots accompanied the most basic hot dog imaginable on the most generic bun. No refill offered this time on drink no straw either.   By far the most cynical  kid's meal I've met. Sure make a profit but don't take the piss!  Fresh carrots are not hard to do  with white film on them.. sorry you've just earned a  1 star. Should have walked out didn't. :(   Entrees.  Cajun steak . Claims to be marinated in spices that I couldn't find. They may indeed have shown them a picture of the process in the recipe but I couldn't find it. Meant to be medium rare but was medium on one side  rare on the other close though:)   Sirloin steak. Cooked as requested  a bit over seasoned.   Sides: Twice baked potato.  If you ever want to open up a salt mine these guy will do it for you. You want an idea of what it's texture was?  Twice chewed would be a better name. Warm vomit with bacon bits would be  a slightly more colorful and chunky term.  Fried onions:   came with whatever was stuck to the grill they came from.The mushrooms were the only thing that were as tasteful as expected. They looked very consistent though  canned?   Never mind they were edible:   Steak soupreally more a stewbut tasted pretty good.  Overall service was ok'ish but walking the kid to the toilet twice the staff just seemed  to want to get to where they wanted to go and not care for the toddler walking up the aisle to the restroom in front of me.  ( that's for this occasion only  past two times it's been great fun for the kid)  1.5 rounded to 1 for the carrots.
pos	I was a regular at Mia's first location in Wrigleyville/Chicago. Scott (the original founder/chef and present owner) is the reason Mia Francesca is what it is. Not sure if us folks up here in Scottsdale know how lucky we are he landed on our door step. Food service vibe...if I could give it six stars I would.
neg	When I was in highschool various clubs used to sell Karsh's bagels around campus to raise money. I would buy a bagel and cream cheese and hide it in my backpack to munch on during class. Soooo good!  I was feeling nostalgic one day and decided to pop in for a bagel and cream cheese.  The guy behind the counter was nice enough I told him my order which came to $2.95 or something just barely under $3.  I had failed to notice the sign which said they do not accept credit cards for purchases under $3. I apologized and said I didn't have any cash and offered to run the the ATM.  The guy behind the counter very nicely asked other lady behind the counter  (the owner? manager on duty maybe?) if she would let me use my card. She looked right at me all stink-eyed and said \"No\" and returned to what she was doing. No apology no \"I'm sorry but there is an ATM at so and so....\" Very curt.  Thanks a lot personality plus! I will not be returning and I hope you choke on a matzo ball.  Shame too I loved those bagels.
pos	Excellent service and food             enjoyed live music on patio
neg	First off the restaurant is dim and dark.. I thought the decor was a little off because they were going for a tropical Vietnam theme with banana trees in there and a waterfall fountain. The waiter there did not have a smile and didn't seem freindly it looked like this was the last place he wanted to be at. The service sucked ass. I mean come on there was only two tables including mines and 3.9/4 of the time he didn't check up on us or refilled our water and we had to walk up to ask for our bill.. like seriously...? Are you that lazy. Bun Bo Hue was skimpy on the meat and had little veggies on the side. Pho had a rancid smell. Noodles in my sister's bun thit nuong were hard and watery (seemed like they were super old) Overall I wouldn't recommend to ANYBODY.
pos	Love Krista!
neg	We went to American Junkie after we found a 50\% discount from http://www.restaurant.com. They couldn't pay us to go back.  If you like velvet ropes not being able to talk to the person next to you because the music is so loud and being around people who are really into themselves American Junkie is your spot.
pos	I attended one of her classes for pressure cookers and had to leave with one. Luckily she offers great discounts after her classes!  Since then I have also gotten a bosch mixer (don't know how I lived without one all these years!) and also a wheat grinder. Everytime I go in here I find something I can't live without!  Shar has great classes and tips on how to utilize all her products. Well worth it to attend a class. I just wish the store was closer to Glendale!  So glad I found shar's now my family enjoys homemade wheat bread and pizzas and all sorts of yummy things that are good for them too!
neg	Avoid at all costs. Awful service slow as hell only uses disposable plasticware/plates to add landfill insult to heinous food.  Despite telling them we were in a rush to catch a plane and multiple reassurances that the food would arrive in plenty of time they lollygagged around and I ended up paying $30 to be seriously pissed off and hungry with no food.   BLECH.
pos	Need fig preserves? They've got it. Fennel? It's beautifully packed on ice and extremely fresh in the produce department. Need boneless pork loin roast from the blade end? The butcher has your back. Duck fat? Just take a peek in the freezer section. Sometimes it's the little things that normally go unnoticed that gets you five stars...  AJ's closed early the other night in lieu of the holidays and I ran around to FOUR different stores looking for something as simple as whole grain mustard and fennel. I came up empty handed on both items. I say \"simple\" items - but it's amazing when you rely on a grocer like this as much as I do and realize that most items are out of reach otherwise. AJ's carries practically anything my culinary desires could ask for!  Although I had to wait a day to go shopping again and to make the recipe i was wanted it was during my adventures to the 4 stores that I realized how much I truly appreciate this grocer. How is it I can get wireless internet via laptop on the I-10 freeway courtesy of my phone company but can't find fennel within a 10 mile radius?  This my friends is why I love AJ's. And as someone who watches America's Test Kitchen as though it were food porn I can say that any other grocer doesn't stand a chance against Eddie Bashas' high end store.  You truly do get what you pay for. For all the employees at AJ's I say \"THANK YOU!!\" for the great service you provide and the products you offer.
neg	I got my nails done there last Thursday for the first and last time. I would never ever go back there. The man who did my nails burnt two of my fingers really bad. The place was dirty and messy and talk about noisy he asked me to many personal questions. To top it off he answered his cell phone and talked on it about 10mins all load and on speaker phone . So rude and bad customer service. It might be a little cheaper there but as the saying goes u get what u pay for!!!!!!!
pos	Love me some hidden house!   The music is too loud. The drinks too cheap. The clientele too local. But I've never had anything but a good time there. Whether it's karaoke or weird shit on the weekends you'll have fun if you don't expect it to be Merc cuz Merc it ain't. And not for one moment in it's life has it pretended to be. But I love it for what it is and that's an experience.
neg	I am DONE with Classic Car Spa their sub-par car washes and their shady business partnerships.    Whatever you do DO NOT get your windshield replaced by the Auto Glass Shop that Classic Car Spa allows on their premises. I am holding Classic Car Spa accountable for placing their customers in such close proximity to criminals.   While these Auto Glass Shop men are friendly and seem helpful it is a scam. They replaced my windshield (and hey it cost me nothing b/c my insurance covers it) and put the glass in wrong THREE TIMES! After one week and many HOURS on the phone with them and my insurance company they are still giving me the run around. So although it was free I will now have to foot the bill for fixing their crappy craftsmanship.   After trying in vain to get my windshield fixed by the Auto Glass Shop I spoke with the manager of Classic Car Spa. I don't think I've ever met a manager with a more relaxed \"who cares?\" attitude. That place is a joke. Except I'm not laughing....
pos	Cowboy Ciao is one my favorite restaurants in Old Town Scottsdale.  To start with they share a wine list with Kazimierz.  My favorite menu item is the Stetson Chopped salad.  My only wish is that the serving was bigger!  I can't get enough...and I'm too embarrassed to order two.  The flavors in this salad are amazing!  Smoked salmon Israeli cous cous creamy dressing.  For dinner I actually like the Exotic Mushroom Pan Fry.  The tastes are really unique and I got to try mushrooms I hadn't had before.  It's great!  I did try the Bacon Peanut Brittle for dessert and I cannot recommend this.  It was not good at all.  It just makes the brittle really greasy and then you run into chunks of bacon...ick.  Thank God my husband ordered the Chocolate/Peanut Butter pot pie so I could steal from him!
neg	Don't waste your time...Arrowhead mall on the other side of town is so much better!
pos	Great Mexican food.  Authentic street tacos plus a full menu of tasty dishes.  Halibut tacos remind me of Ensenada Michelada with Pacifico beer is a perfect beverage for any dish.
neg	I can overcome the hipster sneer and accept that I am an uncool blemish in a world full of cut-off corduroys and patterned leggings. What I cannot and will not get over is an unapologetic staff whose epic error led to me breaking 5 years of meatless eating because of an order mishap.  I ordered the red pepper tomato quiche. After 20 minutes waiting for the quiche to warm in what appeared to be a 200 degree oven I double checked to make sure my name was on the plate at the counter. When I dug in for the first bite a wave of nausea and panic washed over my after realizing this was a piece of the bacon spinach quiche. I returned to the counter and explained that I had ordered the vegetarian quiche and the chic who took my order asked the chic behind the counter which one she served because she was sure she got it right. The chic in the kitchen said she put them out in the order she got them. Then they spent some time looking around in confusion and murmuring a bit  meanwhile all the quiche had been sold. So the counter chic simply turned to me and send \"well we don't have anymore of that one.\"  Thanks. I told her I was more upset about the fact that I had just put bacon in my mouth after 5 years of no meat than there being no more quiche. She did give me my money back but no one apologized or offered me any recompense. I'm over you being cooler than me but I'm not over you having no soul.
pos	What a fabulous dining experience! My boyfriend and I are always looking for new places to try and came upon this place on Yelp when our regular Saturday spot decided to no longer be opened for lunch Saturdays. Right upon entering we were greeted by someone behind the register and he sat us down at a booth. The decor was great and the place was spotless. We ordered the Saturday special of Monte Cristo the potatoes and the biscuits and gravy among other items. The Monte Cristo was perfection and the home made blueberry and strawberry jam was excellent! The potatoes were seasoned to perfection and eggs cooked perfectly. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone and this is now going to be our regular weekend breakfast/brunch place.
neg	Hey Thai Elephant! Stop sucking! You used to be so good. Why is my egg roll cold? Why don't I get a fork with my food.... after asking!? Why won't you make me the Tiger on Fire for lunch when I got it last week for lunch?... AND it's on the menu! When did you decide to cut my curry portion in half almost? When did your service start sucking? Hey every person that decided that my two top was not important enough to attend! Why did it take 10 minutes to order my drink and then an additional ten minutes to actually get my drink? By the way Tiger beer is on your menu. If you are not going to actually offer it then you need to take it off your menu. I can't believe it's come to this... I used to love you. You broke my heart for the last time.
pos	I was sad to come back to lai lai's and they no longer had the Mongolian :( boo but i took my mom there and we were starving so we decided to order off the menu. My mom is allergic to  msg and they helped us with what we should order. and she didn't get sick!! woo hoo.. we ordered three dishes and an appetizer to share between her  my bf and myself and we stilll brought food home and I dont think we spent over $30 bucks for all that food!! it was very good to! i love good cheap food!! Ill be back they are always friendly.
neg	I took my family here and this was a disappointin experience. The service was snobby and rude.  The waitress was condescending and the food was overprices. I have not been to the other Tomasos but I will clearly discourage anyone from dining at the Chandler Tomasos. The service is clearly substandard and snobby.
pos	Very good. My wife and I stopped by randomly on our way back and had beef pho and veggie pho. I eat large portions and this is the first time ever I didn't finish a bowl of pho. If in the area we will stop again for sure.
neg	False ads do not stay there. Unless you don't mind a dirty smelly overrated hotel. The sheets and towels that were supposed to be white were gray. The place is run down and poorly serviced. The front lobby is clean but once you head up to your room you quickly find out that the place is run down and not being taken care of. I stayed on the fifth floor \"cabana suites\" and as soon as my elevator opened up on the fifth floor I knew right away I stayed at the wrong place. The \"suites\" were nothing more than a room with a tiny bit of extra elbow space that are on the rooftop area with a pool in the front of the room. The pool was NASTY! (see pictures I uploaded) It was green and looked disgusting and when I arrived to take a look it had an \"out of order\" sign placed at the entrance. This place was embarrassing! I had told my brothers to book there with me because we thought it was going to be a great hotel based on their website but we were very disappointed again!
pos	Went here today Sunday about 8:50 and it was crowded but not to bad about 1/2 hour wait. Im warning you now dont ask how much longer after you put your name in if they told you how long when you checked in.   About 10am is when it really got packed just about when we got done. I ordered the chicken and waffles and i really liked it. I asked for some butter for my waffle because it didnt come with any and it made the dish perfect for me. The chicken had great flavor and when you take a bite with the waffle and butter and the syrup heaven. I tried some bites without the butter and it wasnt even close to be the same for me.  My grandma got some omellete and she gave me some because she knew she wouldnt finish it and i would order that also. The omelletes are pretty good size but my wifes dish my sons and mine where not that much food especially for $9. We are use to getting enough food for 2 when you eat at breakfast places and slighty cheaper. Not complaining because it was good but be ready.  There was 2 guys sitting next to use and trying to eat there 30 minute food challange. big ass egg plate with bacon and hash browns they both only made thru about halfway.  I would definilty go back and get the same stuff. I also got a lemonade with mint and it was just right. My son really didnt like his reese's pancakes. Id like to go back and try some of this stuff ham steak w/ gravy chicken fried steak w/ hashbrowns bannana pecan caramel french toast
neg	No I simply cannot put in a good review for Miracle Mile.  A coworker recommended this place to me. Actually two coworkers did. However upon inspection of my pie right before I was about to eat it I noticed that there was mold in it.  Yes mold.  Sorry Miracle Mile your fries were bland and while your chicken tenders were decent I can't forgive mold in a pie. I did take a picture of it so I will be adding it to this review as soon as I can.  Who knows if I will get my 2.95 for moldy pie back.  *ETA MM has been notified and I am to receive a gift certificate for my 2.95. I was given the option of returning it but it's over a 40 min drive.
pos	Love this location at Gainey Ranch! Great food consistently!
neg	Food poisoning alert. There is no doubt in my mind that this incident was caused by the order of potato skins I was served at this un-fine dining establishment. First off the cook looks like somebody off the street at least wear an apron buddy.     Now we are watching the games there and it's about 30 minutes after I eat 4 fairly large skins which I dipped in sour cream and the rumbling in the stomach started. Five minutes later I was depositing those skins in their tiny toilet and trying to hold on while the games ended. Lastly another stop was needed on way home to drop off some more skins. This place is full of local drunks but a good watering hole (yeah literally). Go here to drink and stay away from all food. Also it was 8 bucks for one order of skins. Why do places charge the same price for apps as they do for sandwiches. It's another sign of a clueless place with poor food and hygiene. Bad choice.
pos	Our server Gary was awesome. Food was amazing...an experience.
neg	Not worth the money. Food was average and the portion was small for the price I paid.
pos	We started each morning of our vacation at The Breakfast Club.  Everything was so tasty; juices are fresh-squeezed.  Menu has quite a variety and portions are very filling  It gets busy early.  Be sure to give it a try.
neg	Glad this place has new ownership... I should probably remove the review below Its really harsh and doesn't apply to the NEW establishment.  You have been warned ;)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Short Review:  THIS PLACE SUCKS BALLS  Long Review: We were supposed to meet a friend here at Draft House on Saturday night. We were excited to be out on a date-like experience cuz its been a while. We went to my in-laws for dinner and then headed to Draft... I knew it was going to be interesting from the sound of the music as we pulled into the strip mall.   The music: Good music probably the only good thing about this place - if you're a hip-hop fan. All hip-hop all night.   The crowd: Ghetto fab all the way! Seems like everyone there is late 20's - early 30's (and some older sprinkled throughout the crowd) and none realize its not 1996 anymore. Expect to hear a lot of fake accents a la Da Bronx and a lot of misuse of slang terms. It was entertaining until it became annoying. Oh and people WILL steal your seats or tell you they are saved - ugh!  The atmosphere: small crowded...  Small dance floor.  A couple pool tables but don't expect to get one. Some TVs playing various sports which I guess qualifies this place as a \"sports cafe\"??   The service: OMG we had one beer each and the \"line\" was retarded over 30 minutes to tab out. No line in sight just people crowding together trying to get to the front of the line.  Oh! and LOL.. the bar tenders are total morons one of them complained to the guy next to us about his crappy tip and the other argued with his customer about whether they ordered rum and cokes or redbull and vodka.  The guy had already made the rum and cokes and was pissed that HE got it wrong.  Weirdos!  If any of this appeals to you this is your place!   BTW her friend didn't show and we ended up going to Skip n Jan's to play some pool :o)  We had a great time there :o)
pos	I had other piercings done here and then went out of state and got my nose pierced with a friend and when i got back I was having problems with it. I went in and talked to them and they changed out the stud for me gave me a discount on the jewelry and were really fun friendly professional and very informative. This place is top notch. Won't go to another place for my piercings again! No way! It is very clean and these guys know their stuff! Really impressed...I could go on and on! I won't get my jewelry anywhere else either...they have a a great variety and if they don't have something you want they order it easy peasy. Love it!
neg	I will precede this lackluster review by stating the following:  1)I have only been to this place once. 2)I didn't get a chance to actually try the cuisine. 3)I am a sympathetic person to servers as I have been one.  That being said I give this place one star for reasons of poor service.  About six months ago at around 4pm on a Sunday afternoon we decided to eat at this place. The atmosphere was warm and cozy; typical college bar with college-aged waitresses.  We made sandwich selections and ordered happy hour beers. The beers came the food never did and we watched other patrons come in eat and leave.  All the while our waitress never came by to give us an explanation or even get us another round of drinks (we got them ourselves from the bar).   Since my bf and I both worked in food service we are always sympathetic when we can see that a place is under-staffed.  But after an hour of waiting we finally crossed the room to speak with our server. She said \"I can't imagine it will be much longer.\" I think the more professional approach would have been an apology and admitting to forgetting to put in our ticket which is what we gathered when we saw her speaking frantically with the cook.  Where was the manager that day? Or someone who noticed that we sat there so long without our food or any communication at all?  We left money on the table for our beers and walked out. I guess there is a first time for everything.
pos	The food here is awesome every time I come here we have a great time And the waitress kimberly Couldn't ask for better waitress
neg	Went to Fatburger with our family tonight and will not return.   Average food. The burgers were average. The lettuce was wilted the tomato was green and nothing outstanding about the flavor. I'd say better options nearby are Joe's farm grill In-n-out or Culvers.   Cleanliness was average. The floor was a little sticky and the beverage area was kept very neat. The kitchen appeared clean.   Service was below average/horrible. The cashier was very unpleasant. We all ordered at the same time and the first half of the food came out about 15 minutes prior to the 2nd part. It was pretty slow. By the time we got the fries they were cold. The staff literally acted like they were a bunch of highschoolers who were annoyed that there were any customers who interrupted their hangout.   I know this sounds harsh...it is. My experience was absolutely horrible. We will not be back and I don't recommend that you should either.
pos	OK I've decided that other coffee shops sell swill. I think about Dazbog coffee in a dreamy sort of way like unstressed people think about sex. I mourn often that they open so damn late in the morning. Seriously I would be there every day...   The chocolate cappuccino rocks my world and perks me right the hell up even on the mushiest afternoon. No bitterness not overly sweet just blissful- in an I've-just-been-bitch-slapped-by-caffeine sort of way of course.   Oh and the sandwiches I complained about? Replaced by real deli looking ones in clam-shells. Far more appetizing. But what the hell do I need a sandwich for when I can have a giant red velvet cupcake?   Don't make me break out the voodoo Dazbog. Just open at 6:00 am like any other coffee shop and we'll be BFFs.
neg	I was looking into gyms around the area. Upon entering I was greeted by the front desk guy. I asked about memberships and then he said \"Sorry we are sold out\". I stood there stunned. Then he snickered \"Just kidding\". Trying to be a good sport I went with it.   Next came the young sales guy. He was personable - at first anyways. Showed me around the gym and I was interested in joining. Next we went over to the childcare area since I have a little one. Children were in the room however the two girls monitoring the room were chatting it up with one another and ignoring the kids. Bad sign. I asked the girls if they were CPR certified and had fingerprinting and background checks. The world stopped for just a moment and they stared at me. I had interrupted their important conversation. Then they were both saying \"Yeah like well um no I mean yes\". In other words no straight answers.   We sat at the sales guy's desk and the wheeling and dealing began. I felt like I was purchasing a new car. \"If you choose option A you then can go to all the gyms.\" \"If you choose option B then only here\" . The whole time I could see the children's area and the kids were being completely ignored (and we are talking very little children). When I told the sales man I needed to think about it he switched into some type of Dr. Jekyll Mr. Hyde routine. \"Well you only have today to make a decision after that no price guarantee!!!\"   From there he was down right rude.  I walked out of there thinking what the heck just happened. Like Sarah G I felt horrible when I left this gym.  It was an awful experience. Ended up getting a membership at Tangible Fitness on 7th Street. They don't have the same amenities however it is locally owned and the people are very nice there.
pos	What's not to love? Herb n Flavors uses local high quality ingredients the food tastes GREAT and they are vegetarian vegan and gluten-free friendly! I especially liked their vegan spinach and artichoke dip! We will definitely be back soon : )
neg	Pho-yuck this place!   I was tricked in to going here with promises of great Vietnamese. I was ready for a culinary adventure and what I got was a ride in the fright house.   The Bánh xèo was so greasy I couldn't eat it it was literally served on a plate of grease.   The bun was about the same. It lacked flavor the rice noodles were slimy the spring roll was loaded with grease.   I ordered some sort of plum soda drink and it had a cup of salt on the bottom of the glass.  The service was horrible and I will not be back.
pos	Excellent New Mexico style food great hatch green chile.
neg	omg...hands down the worst chinese food I've ever had anywhere.  Stopped by for lunch with my wife.  I ordered their cashew chicken dish and my wife ordered the pad thai noodles with shrimp.  Barely edible.  Makes Panda Express look like gourmet chinese food.  Prior to Flo's the distinction of the worst chinese food went to a chinese restaurant in Nebraska...but that's Nebraska.  I'm chinese and live in San Francisco so know a thing or two about good chinese food.
pos	I love this location! The food is always great and the service is good. Wi-fi is a plus especially since I am going to school. I come here almost everyday. I recommend this location to everyone.
neg	We checked out RnR on Sunday (just a few days after opening.) In all fairness I have to agree with many of the other reviews. Even though they are new these things are fixable so hopefully the feedback will be taken in the appropriate vein. The building is very cool and the vibe was energetic on a sunny Sunday morning. There was an abundance of waiters but they seemed to be confused and frenetic without a real focus on the customer. The menu is very limited and our server had not eaten most of the items. He was struggling to explain. Our drinks took more than 15 minutes to arrive even though we saw them sitting at the bar for the entire time. Our water had just disappeared. Then the food. I ordered the grill cheese ( a rare treat and when I order it I want it good!). It was cold and overwhelmed by heavy bread. The cheese wasn't melted. I sent it back and they simply nuked it and brought it out. Icky. Our son wanted a kids cheeseburger and the staff kept coming back and forth not sure if there was a single burger or sliders for kids. It became comical after the third person came out. My husband ordered a salmon omelet with several additional fixings. The eggs tasted like box eggs and it was lackluster and flavorless. We even took the time to provide feedback to management but we got a weak smile and \"come back and try us again.\" He made no effort to \"make things right\" either by comping something else to taste or providing an incentive to come back. There are too many restaurants in town to have to go to one that is less than mediocre. The young crowd may enjoy it for the bar vibe it gives but the majority of the tables on Sunday am were families or middle aged and we saw similar responses at other tables.
pos	Awesome country club. Great new remodled gym heated Olympic pool for year round use.  Love the family like atmosphere plenty of planned family events/pool parties.   Only complaint wish members who didn't pay for the monthy tennis membership could still rent a court on a need by need basis.   Regardless courts are top notch great facilities and friendly staff.
neg	We decided to hit up the \"Wine Down Wednesday\" that was happenin' at Tastings courtesy of KYOT.  Here's what went wrong:  The event is from 6-8 so we arrived just a few minutes (3 maybe?) after 6 so we could get a spot just in case it was hoppin'.  We walked in and the hostess (she looks like she's possibly the manager or owner) asked if we were there for the event and then pointed us towards the back room where the event was being held.  We walked in and there were about 7 tables and there were people at them all already.  Talk about early bird gets the worm!  We had to wait for about 3-4 minutes for the waitress to finish with a table to find out if we could sit on the patio for the event.  She said yes and that she would be right out to help us.  In the meantime another woman and her friend also took up at a patio table nearby.  20 minutes later the hostess/owner/manager looking woman came out and asked if we had been helped yet.  We said no and she left only to return with a small happy hour flier menu which she just handed from a distance and didn't even come over to our table.  I know you're wondering why I would wait the 15 minutes but I really wanted to see just how bad the service was going to be and frankly I just wanted some good $2 wine.  It's been about 5 minutes and the same woman comes back with full detailed menus and I asked if the happy hour flier was the deals for the event and she said yes and then asked if we were ready to order.  Um you just gave us the menus 10 seconds ago...  By now I'm ready to just order and enjoy the meal deals from the event.  I look over the happy hour flier and I see some app deals.  They said there was a specialty appetizer menu.  Not so much but whatever.  I can deal with that.  Then I see the drink section.  The claim for the event was $2 glasses of wine.  I was excited to try some nice new wines on the cheap but again... not so much.  In reality it was $4 glasses of house wine which only consisted of three different wines that weren't really what I was looking for.  By now the other women that were outside decided to leave having had enough of this shenanigans.  We decided (after 30 minutes since we arrived) to go next door to Sprouts get some apps and have our own \"Wine Down Wednesday\" at home.  I bet there are plenty of people that will have good experiences here and continue to visit happily but this one experience has caused me to write them off for good (which I don't usually do after one instance).  I wish that I could actually review their wine and food but the service was so poor and substandard that it's not worth giving them my money.  I understand if the food isn't good at a restaurant - some are just better or more talented than others.  However any business can and should have good customer service.  I think this is where the cliched line of \"if I could give them less than 1 star I would\" comes in...  Oh yeah and I slapped down a \"You've been Yelped\" card as I left.  Take that Tastings!!
pos	This is probably the sweet I crave the most! Salted Butter Caramel! Yummmm! When I cant make it up to Scottsdale I stop by my local Whole Foods in Chandler and pick up a pint from the freezer section and it is just as good.
neg	Bad quality ingredients. I ordered a red curry beef and the beef was awful hard I tried to chew it for a minute and decided to give up.
pos	This was the first real ballet I have ever been to and I was so excited it was the Nutcracker! I have been wanting to see the Nutcracker for years.   Thanks to Lindsey and Yelp I had the opportunity to go and the performance was just stunning. When I walked in I noticed the lobby was beautifully decorated a gentleman reading a story to children and a ballet dancer posing for pictures. The bartenders we bought our drinks from was very friendly and accomodating.   I can't say enough about how beautiful the performance was from the dancers the sets the costumes etc. Just incredible. I may just take my daughter to see it with me this season....
neg	There was hair in the food. Not just 1 but 2 in the same Bhel Puri dish.  The whole experience was pretty bad. There is no indication of how you order your food and when you finally figure it out the food does not taste good. We checked sodas on the order sheet and when no sodas showed up we asked if we were supposed to go and find our own sodas from the front of the store and were told that that was the case.  Also the guy at the counter is down right dismissive.  Pani Puri was OK Papdi Chaat - boring no flavor Bhel Puri - boring and no flavor before we found the hairs  Not worth the trip.
pos	Great service
neg	I had never been to Rainforest Cafe and I'm glad that I got to try it because I love trying things at least once; however this will also be my last time going there. We'll start from the beginning:   The atmosphere was nice for the \"jungle\" but it was so loud that I could not hear my wife talking to me. I felt that I had to scream at her to talk. Our waitress was nice but didn't check on us often. We barely understood her either because she speak loud enough. We got our drinks (ten mins later) and my iced tea was good but my wife's chocolate shake was gross. Too much chocolate syrup and it was expensive!! We sent it back so she could get water another 10 mins later. Food delivery was quick and my burger was pretty good but it was plain and $12!! Jeez so expensive for something so plain!!! I got onion rings for an extra few dollars (they were okay but worth the extra few $$$). My wife got an extra plate of fries and they were a few bucks but they didn't give her more than ten! I like the atmosphere of the restaurant and the theme but they are completely over priced!!!! Not worth it at all! The food was mediocre but left me sick that night.   Not as amazing as I thought it would be after seeing it many times in Vegas...
pos	My favorite Starbucks in Mesa. It's not even the closest one to my home but worth the experience. GREAT staff.
neg	I don't like the pizza hear and if you go for lunch there are no specials by the slice.  The ranch tastes bottled and tastes gross.  The ingredients are not fresh but rather canned (also gross).  The chicken wings were not that great either.  The atmosphere was nice for a casual place with a couple of flat screen TV's on the wall.  I will not be going back to this place so hopefully they get better soon since Barro's pizza is going in the area soon.
pos	The food was flavorful and plenty of it. Eating with only your fingers is quite fun - make your momma proud. My girlfriend won the best dish of the night - lentils and chicken and cabage/carrots. It all had kind of sweetish/bitterish/spicy flavor. I had the lamb and jalapeño dish which was kind of greasy. You eat with your fingers and can scoop up the food with the bread they give you - a tartish type crepe which goes well with the food. I'd be happy to go back and try something different.  If you are used to frozen pizzas and Burger King you might want to stick with that as this experience might bit be as enjoyable as those who are more open to what they consume.
neg	eeew. It started with a cranky waiter who told me that if I wanted to know the specials then I should have read them on the board. The food was downhill from there. The entire place smelled like fried onions.
pos	I honestly have only positive things to say about Postino's since every one of my visits here has been very pleasant. From the valet who is running his ass off to the food and everything in between this place does it all right! If you go here hungry you should know that your options are basically a panini a salad or some bruschetta. I've had a little bit of everything and for the value and quality you can't go wrong the the bruschetta. I recently determined my favorite to be the ricotta dates and pistachio but a close second is the salami and pesto.  Wine by the glass can be a bit steep so if you're planning to stay for a bit and can agree on a style with your company you might be better off getting a bottle. A bottle is pretty much 3x the price of a glass so you end up getting 1 1/2 glasses extra. Bonus!  Someday I'll actually take advantage of their $20 deal for wine and bruschetta!
neg	Needs a new name - now.    The Pischke's of old had such a sad ending.  I appreciated McGrath's effort to keep \"Pischke's\" alive.  But it is nothing nothing nothing like the Pischke's of old.  Call it \"The Blue Ribbon Cafe\" - take out the PIschke name - I can't imagine that Chris PIschke would have been honored to be remembered this way.  If his restaurant was a reflection of who he was as a person - Pischke's Blue Ribbon Cafe would be the exact opposite of who he was.    The current restaurant is not a laid back family friendly and yet a bar all at once restaurant that serves an unending array of crazy good sandwiches/salads/etc - the current decor is pretentious and the food matches that.
pos	we went back here again this past weekend...actually we went there 3 more times this past weekend alone!  we couldn't resist the awesome service and great prices...and great live music.  this is definately going to be one of our \"regular joints.\"  if you like the country...country girls....and good old rowdy shit..then stop by and check it out for yourself.  i bet you will like this place.   there is a large dance floor for some shit kickin' ...about 3 pool tables..big buck hunter and an outdoor area for smokin and boozin and dart throwin'.  i love this place.  this is what toby keith should have been singing about...seriously!
neg	OK. So I think that this may be the first business that gets one star from me.  I just flew home from Israel on this airlines.  Boy they are pretty sad.  I usually don't like to be too harsh on anyone but this airlines deserves it.    Please don't think of this review as complaining but rather a warning to others out there to never fly US airways (Nobody likes a complainer right? Haha.).  Well not never but if you have no other choice.  I would venture to guess that this airlines is pretty cheap because of the full flight loads that i encountered.  You could say that is good for them but the service on the planes was not up to par.  I guess I have been spoiled with the likes of Hawaiian Airlines Nippon airlines shoot you can even throw Delta in there.  The flight attendants are rude. This is from both personal experience and from observation of my own.    You know what I could go on and on but I really don't like to cry about stuff.  Would I fly US Airways again? No way.  If it was one of the last airlines on Earth?  Maybe.  I just hope that their service of customers get better.    Then again maybe they didnt treat me well for the fact that I hadn't shaved and looked Talibanish.  Oops.
pos	I found this little hot spot on Yelp and used my phone to navigate me there; I wouldn't have found it otherwise.  This small establishment is hidden in a neighborhood right off of Historic Downtown Chandler.  It's a quaint little diner with modest décor.  I felt very comfortable there and the service was fast and friendly.  As I looked over the menu the first thing I saw was the Morning Monte and havarti cheese as one of the ingredients.  Cheddar isn't better; it's all about havarti folks!  I needn't look further; I knew that's what I was having.  Hawaiian bread French toast bacon turkey egg and the havarti - absolutely delicious!  Can't wait to come back and bring everyone I know.
neg	Called last night @ 4:30 and tried to do call ahead seating for 6:30 for a party of 9. We are in town and are here to see some friends. Explained to hostess that some in the group are seniors so would need to have assurance on reservation. I was told to call back in an hour the thought process by her was that it was too soon to give me a time and they weren't that busy yet. So I did as told and called back and after about 10 minutes of confusion and other waiting I was told we couldn't be seated until 7:30 or we could have seperate booths. I explained that we needed to sit together and 2 hours was the best she could do. I was so frustrated I told her no thanks that we would find other arrangements. She said ok and that was it. Nice job Texas Roadhouse. NOT!!! There is no excuse for not having a reservation system in place like Open Table. One day there will be no customers to disappoint then maybe you will get it.
pos	The mall of malls for sure! So many designer boutiques so little time! On this trip I was given the utmost in attention from the fabulous women at the Fossil store....what fun they were! I enjoyed a smoked chicken & black bean salad @ Z Tejas next and the service was excellent. I then perused the new styles at Aqua before finding a great pair of shades at Solstice = shopper's bliss :) This review is a bit late; I visited the center on 1/27/12 - and I'll be back :)
neg	Just had Daphnes for the last time. In the 3 times that we have ordered from them they cannot seem to get a simple order right. One Kids Burger with Apple Slices (Nope) one side of hummus(Nope) But they are quick to charge you for the order. Then you call and talk to a girl name Liz and she begins to tell you that they are correct and you the customer are wrong. Even though I have all the food sitting in front of me nope still no kids burger or side of hummus. HMMMMM.. keep letting her answer the phone and you will see your to go customer base decline. We are an office in Scottsdale that everyday is ordering lunch for the office Daphnes has officially been removed from the menu book.  Nice customer service!!!!!!
pos	What an unbelievable night we had at Mastro's City Hall Steakhouse. Everything we ate was top notch the atmosphere is fun and the service is spectacular. How many steakhouses play Jim Croce Beatles and Beach Boys? It's a very welcome change.  It's dark it's sexy and it's probably the best steakhouse in Arizona.   The seafood tower featured totally fresh and delicious oysters crab legs claws and huge shrimp. My Kansas City Strip was out of this world and probably the best piece of meat I've had all year. Gorgonzola mac & cheese and sauteed mushrooms were real winners as well. I'm not a dessert person but the warm butter cake should be illegal it's so good. I was stuffed already when it came to the table and then I ate all of it.   The only hiccup all night was our seafood tower was short a shrimp and when I told the waiter don't worry about it he said ok and then proceeded to bring us a fourth shrimp on it's own bed of ice. It was a really top notch recovery. This place is absolutely amazing.
neg	Considering what is considered the 'norm' for workout facilities... this place is WAY behind the times.  This place would be amazing for 1952- it would then be considered clean tidy and cutting edge. There are some actual perks about this place- they do have daycare and plenty of mirrors for me to watch my fat jiggle while I run on the treadmill ;)  It's just an utter disaster. When the BF and I originally signed up we got a couples membership at a newly redone Glendale location and it was worth the monthly membership fee.  This place does not need a 'face-lift.' It needs to be gutted and TOTALLY renovated. You just feel a nasty moistness when you walk in the door- which just gets worse the longer you're there... and is even MORE WORSE during the summer. Guys always have the weight benches dominated. There's never any availability for machines (any kind) from 4-7:30pm then it starts to thin out. Blah bla bla blah bla.  Considering this is the \"Biltmore\" location... huge disappointment. Fact.
pos	So your going to Scottsdale via Paradise Valley....or your coming from Scottsdale heading east....your stomach is growling but you don't want the usual...then look no further than Jason's Deli. I was in that situation on Friday night and decided to give this locale a try....and I must say I was not disappointed. I had the Smokey Jack Panini with Smoked turkey breast....guacamole....provolone cheese....lettuce...tomato....bacon on the side which I gave to my wife....LOL...since I don't eat red meat....and Russian dressing. However sandwich was made to order and pressed perfectly on the grill....and the flavor was outstanding. They give you a pickle and homemade potato chips on the side....and I also had some lemonade which comes from a fountain with free refills.   I almost missed out on the free Ice Cream....but I seen people walking around with cones of Ice Cream and I had my wife ask was it free. Indeed it was and we both enjoyed a nice Ice Cream cone....mine was chocolate vanilla swirl...and you can also get it in a cup as well. The service was great and the whole place had a real nice neighborhood feel to it.....I look forward to returning here very soon. Eat Drink and be Merry my Friends!!!!
neg	This place was messy and loud.  The food really wasn't great and the salsa bar looked like a three year old put it together.  Overall the only plus was the tortilla chips that were free before the food.  I will not be back unless one of my friends pays for me
pos	After a year in the Valley one of my girlfriends took me to Side Bar.  I really like the atmosphere.  It was sleek yet cozy. The night we went in it was hopping but not overly crowded.  A welcome sight considering much of my first year in the Valley was spent in crowded pretentious Scottsdale hotspots.   As I get older I crave more intimate setting and SideBar fits the bill.  Also I give five stars to any business who goes out of their way to help a good cause.  SideBar is just that kind of establishment.  If anyone is on Twitter follow #buzzcation.  @SideBarphx has let #buzzcation folks hold a number of networking and fundraising happy hours.  It's a cool crew so come out and joing and I commend SideBar for always accomodating this crazy crew of tweeples. :)
neg	Einsteins in general has mediocre bagels at best and their \"schmears\" appear to be highly processed.  I've generally given up on Einsteins all together because because their food has really taken a nose dive as has the service.  I stopped by this location recently because I was driving by and in a hurry and wanted a bagel (they're supposed be a bagel store after all!).  First no salt bagels.  Aren't salt bagels one of the standards?  Second I ordered my bagel with cream cheese (cream cheese being a $1.50 option) to go and that was my real mistake.  Whoever made the bagel didn't even manage to slice all the way through the bagel and put an amount of cream cheese approximately equivalent to a pat of butter on one-half of the bagel.  The other half was basically dry.  Unbelievable.  Needless to say I was pretty annoyed when I got to work and opened up my bagel.  Stick to any of the local bagel joints like Chompies or Kashmans - they have much better bagels and they will dump a brick of cream cheese on them for you.
pos	I've been a bunch of times for takeout and took a seriously picky foodie friend this past weekend.  Everything I've had here has been excellent and I mean excellent.    In the past I've had the margherita pizza eggplant parm and fried calamari.  All good.  This weekend we had the comp tapenade beef carpacchio lasagna and one of the pizzas (can't remember name -- had olives art hearts ham and ?).  All delicious.  The lasagna was so delicate but melded perfectly with the sauce.  My very particular picky friend LOVED the place.  Seriously loved it.
neg	Man oh man... I can't decide whether I want to review this place or not under the auspices of \"if you don't have anything nice to say...\"  All I have to say is this:   We ordered food. It came totally wrong. I asked for a vegan salad not specifically but that's how I ordered it and it came with chicken and cheese. This just shows a complete inability to read the order. People make adjustments all the time. I have worked at a restaurant. I have fucked up. I should have been lashed 40 times! Read what people order!   So when I got the wrong salad and saw what an unbelievable disappointment it was going to be I ordered a veggie sandwich instead which to their credit they delivered and took off the bill.   The best customer service in the world could not overcome this sandwich. It was a monumental fucking embarrassment. I cannot believe they let that thing out the door. I ate it because I was starving but I would have liked to have driven it back there and go through it ingredient by ingredient with the preparer... Explain to me how this is appealing to the eyes mouth stomach etc.  I just hated it. A lot.   Sorry I'm sure you're nice people with good intentions.
pos	As good as it gets.  We ate here for a birthday celebration and we were taken away by the great food and service (as usual).  We requested the V Lounge and were given a nice corner booth.  When we sat down there was a birthday card signed by the employees of the restaurant -- a very nice touch.  For appetizers we had oysters and the (best) crab cakes (anywhere).  Steaks and seafood as our main courses paired well with the red cabernet wine.  Overall just incredible.  Completely up to par with Eddie V's standards -- comparing to Houston and Austin.  My mom forgot her sweater at the booth and a hostess ran out to give it to her.  We also got a follow-up phone call the next day asking how everything went.  For those special occasions or a fun happy hour Eddie V's never lets you down!  Also their Banana's Foster is divine!  Save room for it or just stuff your face and go to the gym the next day -- delish!
neg	Maybe I should have had a hot dog but I crave Chicago's Italian beef  I didn't get it here just some greasy old beef of some kind  use beef broth if the meat gets dry not a whole can of olive oil  YUK!  It didn't have that good Italian beef flavor so I asked for giardinara to add some flavor  it was very oily too and I had to pay extra for any peppers either hot or mild. No stars for that beef  the only saving grace was it didn't make me too sick  I expected to be sick for days not just one day!
pos	Heart be still I loved this place. Way better than I expected. I had the spicy noodles and they were delicious flavor great and quality was on point. For desert the sticky rice with mango I dream about it now. Highly recommend if you are in the mood for Thai food. I'll be back!
neg	Every time I come here the staff is so rude! Its the closest bar to my gate so I'm kinda stuck. Hey staff can you please pretend to like people????
pos	Still 5 stars but sadly Amber is closing up shop.  Don't feel bad for her as it is not for the lack of business.  She is getting married and leaving the state and taking Spoken with her.  Damn her!!!  I did pick up some jeans and 3 shirts all at 60\% off.  So hurry over and pick up some bargains!  And wish Amber good luck!
neg	I dined at this restaurant on a Saturday morning and was actually the very first guest.  I got greeted by the hostess and was promptly seated.  The service was phenomenal from when I walked over the door step and the ambiance is the restaurant was amazing .  I ordered the smoked salmon as an appetizer and the daily scallop special as the entree.  When my salmon dish came out I said to my self \"WHAT in the hell?\" Two extremely thin slices of salmon little salad and a piece of bread with some aioli on the side.  Salmons cheap and they charged me $15 for this crap?  I work in the food industry and the food was crap.  Next the entree.  The waiter described the the scallop dish like it was heaven on earth.  Explaining to me how delicious this special was.  So I took his advice and ordered.  When the dish came out I said to my self again \"What in the HELL?\"  Four small scallops 2 baby carrots broccoli rabe and cilantro sauce.  The scallops weren't seared enough the broccoli rabe was brown and mush and the baby carrots were still raw.  The funny thing was.  The sauce didn't even resemble any cilantro flavor at all.  I could of made this dish 1000x better and the entree took a big hit in my wallet $32 for crap.  The meal came out to roughly $60 and I left that restaurant to never try it again.  I could of gotten some pho for $8 would of been a hundred times happier than spending money that wasn't even mediocre.
pos	This is my favorite spa in the world! Hopefully I'll make it to others...but if I could only get to the Camelback Inn I'd be in heaven. Here's the rundown of how I enjoy the place: Early morning appointment for massage - Rose does fantastic hot stone - I like her the best. Then I shower and get into the eucalyptus steam room. Next I head out to the pool and savor the view of Camelback Mountain and the amazing desert landscaping they've procured. I drink some water and as I lounge there I order a small healthy and very tasty meal (usually breakfast). I swim a little lounge a lot - regardless of the time of year.  If I have planned it I then head back into the showers and clean up for my next treatment. I spend hours there and if I feel like I might be pressed for time I reschedule.
neg	Cool place but don't try to arrange a special event. The proprietor was arragont unflexible and unethical when I held my friend's bachelorette party at The Duce. Be warned!
pos	3 syllables for this place.  A-MAZ-ING!  The best Phoenix has to offer.
neg	Yikes...I won't be going back.  The ordering system is confusing. The staff also seemed confused. The food was very bland and pretty tasteless.  THIS PLACE IS NOT EVEN IN THE SAME LEAGUE AS HONEY BEAR'S NEAR THE AIRPORT!! Skip this bland chain and go to Honey Bear's!
pos	I've been coming here since the 70's when it was across the street and had a screen door. I know the staff and the daily specials by heart.  When I lived away from PHX it was the place I wished for. When I go to NYC I have to take RM food to my friends. The whole family agrees. I don't understand the negative reviews. The reviewers must have had a bad day. I love the food and so has everyone  I know.
neg	After repeat visits it just gets worse - the service that is.  It was as if we were held hostage and could not leave for a full 25 minutes because that's how long it took to receive hour check after several requests to several different employees.  Female servers might be somewhat cute but know absolutely nothing about beer and this is a brewpub.  I asked if they have an seasonal beers and the reply was no that they only sell their own beers!  Even more amusing is their \"industrial pale ale\" is an IPA but it is not bitter.  So they say it's an IPA but it's not bitter it's not a true-to-style IPA.  Then people say \"Oh I don't like IPA's\" and want something else.  Their attempt to rename a beer/style is actually hurting them.  Amazing.  The menu was not the regular menu just a small list of about 4-5 choices.  To make it worse the actual menu on every table was wrong yet the kept the menus on the tables anyway.  I heard 3 separate tables order the fried raviolis but they did not have them.    This place is *only* in business because of the location location location.
pos	The food and service were both amazing. I've had the gyro pita orzo and greek potatoes. All were fantastic. Try the gelato also. It's the best in town! The owners are very friendly and happy to speak with each customer.
neg	No offense to everyone who gave this place 5 stars but the Tempe Cinema staff needs a swift kick in the ass. During school hours this place is regularly crawling with hooligan truants. Maybe those who run this theatre want to ensure they will have a steady stream of staffing options from the dropouts who use it as a hideout. Losers.
pos	Rita's Kitchen is a hidden gem located right smack in the center of the Camelback Inn. While this may be a hot-spot for hotel guests I think that locals might be missing out on its charm.   I am a huge fan of anything the Camelback Inn does especially since they offer live music and a great space for relaxation and Rita's Kitchen is no exception. This restaurant is airy and opens up to the spacious Camelback Inn patio where they play live music every night.   Breakfast:   Breakfast at Rita's is sublime and pretty reasonably priced. They offer a breakfast buffet for around $23 which includes eggs made to order (including omelets) pancakes waffles pastries fresh fruit bacon sausage and hashbrowns. It's a great pick for a leisurely weekend breakfast. Just today was Mother's Day and while we only did the breakfast buffet I did catch a glimpse of the Mother's Day brunch and holy moly do they know how to wow a crowd! Not only did they have stations set up all throughout the restaurant patio and R-Bar but they also had an extensive dessert area with build-your-own sundaes freshly made cotton candy (in an old fashioned cotton candy maker) and a long dessert table with a chocolate fountain.   Lunch:  Lunch here is sublime and I also enjoy either the tacos or the chicken sandwich. The chicken sandwich is particularly a favorite of mine due to the cheese and sauce. The fries are tasty as well and you can either get sweet potato or regular. I also get sweet potato then regret not just getting the regular which are better in my mind. If the weather permits sit on the patio and enjoy the beautiful water fountains views of the mountain and tropical/desert setting.
neg	I was really excited to try this restaurant and tonight my husband and I came and ordered food to take-out. The service was very friendly and the store was clean cute and colorful...but the food was very disappointing. My husband ordered the curry chicken and although it tasted okay he literally almost choked on tiny bones in the meat 4 or 5 times. I asked ahead of time if they used white meat and was told yes but the \"Calypso Pasta\" I ordered had tiny tiny pieces of dark meat jerk chicken...instead of the boneless white strips I was expecting and really it was just mediocre. I'm bummed I wanted to like this place.
pos	We happened upon this location when meeting a friend for dinner.  When I showed up there was a line of about 20 people ahead of me.  i asked them to put me in first available and they said 15-20min and then 45min for a booth.  Ok I'll wait.  Our friends showed up and my girlfriend had asked if there was a spot at the bar we could sit in the mean time.  We were there for about 10min already.  That's when she said to us. \"Your table inside is ready\"  she walked us right there and we were sat.  WOW!  that was quick!  We ordered drinks and food.  I got these jerk chicken wings for an appetizer and holy cow they were delicious.  For my main dish I ordered a garlic noodle dish.  It definitely hit the spot.  My only beef would be that it was hard to talk with so many people inside.  I wont let that affect the rating though.  Awesome place!
neg	From my door it's a five minute stroll through the greenbelt to Dukes. They have a nice patio. They have enough TVs to show all MLB/NFL/NBA games. They have plenty of shuffleboard and pool tables. Yet I've only been to Duke's a few times and I am not going back. This place is just bad.  Mixed drinks are poured short and use cheap mixers (such as bottled sour mix for margaritas). They offer a pretty basic beer selection. I think PBR pitchers might be more modestly priced but that might be only when they're on \"special.\"  The food is pretty bad even for bar food. And pricey. Sure the menu is gigantic and I've tried many different items but I didn't find anything good. Everything seems to be made from \"freezer to fryer\" or packaged products. I'm not exaggerating: the burger and fries for about $8 is a thin previously frozen patty with a handful or supermarket fries. I could go on about salads sandwiches and ribs. In the same price range you can get a much better version of anything on the menu at Four Peaks or Zipps or even Devil's Advocate.  One of the owners was there on a few occasions. I guess being the boss of (and drinking in) his own bar is some sort of dream of his. He treats the place like his kingdom. He'll ask patrons \"how is everything?\" and get mad at them if they have anything negative to say. I feel bad for the rest of the service staff; they seem to be above average but when the overall situation is this bad it just doesn't matter.  In this city sports bars are a dime a dozen. I'd rather go elsewhere.
pos	We stayed at the Hyatt Gainey Ranch during spring break and had a fabulous time. We ate at SWB for lunch and enjoyed it so much we ordered dinner that evening to eat in the room with our kids. My husband ordered me the chocolate caramel tart which turned out to be one of the best desserts I've ever had. I tried looking for the recipe and couldn't find it so I figured it wouldn't hurt to ask for it. Surprisingly I received an almost immediate response from the hotel that they would let the chef know. Within a few hours the recipe from the chef was in my e-mail with additional tips! Now I call that customer service. We loved the hotel and loved the restaurant. Looking forward to going back someday.
neg	Wow?!  Is this the new Barcelona?!  Yuck!  Old scuzy men and middle aged women with fake boobs that are falling out of their painted on dresses.  All bars were completely under staffed on a Friday night.  We waited 7 minutes at the front bar until being ignored continuously and we became so frustrated that we made our way to the round bar and it seemed just as understaffed.  What's the point of only having a few bartenders on probably the busiest night of the week for bar-goers?  We even approached the blond manager to ask for service and she was completely rude and had a total lack of desire to help us.  We will NOT return due to the lack of service and efficiency.  This place has GOT to staff more bartenders and needs much more help.  Welcome to North Scottsdale Barcelona.
pos	Called these guys when an evap cooler water pressure line at my office burst.  A guy with a clean white shirt tucked in to his pants introduced himself to me assessed my problem and quoted a very fair price to fix it. This guy was way too clean personable and professional to be the plumber? He went right to work and had everything back to normal for me in no time! You have to understand... I am use to a dirty loud intrusive  plumber that smiles with his butt!  These guys won me over and their telephone number 623-977-4458 is in my cell phone now.  I highly recommend Palmer's Plumbing!!!
neg	So what kind of place serves chicken fingers and NO Ranch dressing?????? The only sauces they had was honey mustard and \"Canes Secret sauce\" Can I say EEWWWW!! I thought that the sauce tasted terrible. I am not too big a fan of honey mustard but I do On occasion eat it if there is nothing else And that wasn't even good! The coleslaw was awful also. I do have to say that the chicken fingers were very juicy but also very bland. Those were the only 2 items that I tried not that there were really any more items  on the menu Texas toast? And Fries I think?? Overall I would never go back.
pos	I got a coupon at a past Yelp event to try them out and I'm SO glad I did!  Massage Envy really exceeded my wildest expectations for a chain that offers affordable rates for massage therapy.  I was pleasantly surprised by the level of expertise and professionalism that I experienced!  My massage therapist was Dannie and she worked through my trigger points and loosened my tight muscles with an intuition that I have rarely experienced.  I highly recommend this place and hope to return soon!
neg	I hadn't been to Fuddruckers for about 20 years... now I know why.  Cashier was nice and very helpful.  I ordered bacon cheese burger combo.  Fries were only warm not hot.  Burger was not very tasty and it was full of gristle bits... you know the ones that stick between your teeth.  Lots of trash on the floor.  After we were finished someone came to ask how things were.  I told here about the fries and she offered to get me more; I declined.  She offered a free dessert: I accepted.  In all not a good experience will probably be at least another 20 years before I go back.
pos	Ask for Alex - he is very helpful and knowledgeable with products in the store. He is a young college student and works part time but always has a great attitude and finds the best deals for our family. Thanks Alex!
neg	Everything about this company sucks. Walmart treats their customers and employees horribly I mean HORRIBLY! They destroy the communities in which they sit. I'm done never shopping here again I don't care how cheap something might be there is a high cost to low prices afterall...
pos	It's the place to be.   I went before heading over to Symphony Hall and seeing Ballet AZ perform Giselle. Having heard great reviews about the place it's food and the vibe... I had to try it.  Restored into a restaurant and bar from an old department store Hanny's has the feel straight of of New York City. The lighting is dim enough to give that sexy intimate feelings and with long pew style seating with individual tables the vibe is very posh.  My roommate and I ordered the bruscetta plate and the margarita pizza. Very good choice! The bruscetta plate was on the saltier side so be wary of that but it was delish. The pizza was much bigger than we expected. For $10 you really do get a good deal.   We each orded drinks. A orded the peach martini and a glass of giseling. Wasn't a HUGE fan of the martini and I thought it tasted like cough syrup but it was also my very first martini so I am not holding Hannys against anything. My roommate on the other hand said it was the best Manhattan he'd ever had which I believe.  Hannys has a modern feel with a touch of Mad Men and I simply cannot wait to go back.
neg	Bad experience...Terrible service terrible food.  First of all I was organizing a Happy Hour and Dinner for a retirement party that we had on Friday August 3rd 2012.  Reading the fine print on the website it did say that happy hour prices were in the bar area although because it was a party of 30 we could not fit in that area.  One of the attendees called the restaurant and spoke with the Manager which he confirmed that we were going to have happy hour prices. It turns out when we got to the restaurant they thought we were another party for 40 people that booked the spot for happy hour but the attendee that spoke with the Manager was misinformed and they only gave us one round of happy hour prices.  Second of all our server was awful.  There were a couple of servers that actually waited on us because there was a table of 10 people.  Anyways she took wrong orders and did not listen to our needs and was rushed rushed rushed.  Then a new person came in late on our table and she was not even served when she saw her.  We had to track her down. I am sorry but the amount of restaurants that I have been to this was the worst service ever.  I mean I had servers that actually new who was new at the table and took their order once they arrived.  I ordered full size of fried green tomatoes 1/2 order of fried okra and a plate of sweet potato fries.  The server gave me my fried green tomatoes but gave me full size of fried okra and the sweet potato fries was horrible.  So I had the server take my sweet potato fries because it was awful.  The server took it away without even asking me if I wanted another batch. I don't cook much but I probably can fry those tomatoes alot better than the restaurant. I told the server I ordered 1/2 size of fried okra and she said ok and brought it back to the kitchen then she brought the same dish back and said that she will just charge me for the 1/2 size order.    And lastly when the server gave us the bill it was all separate checks and did not even do that right.  The server was putting stuff on the bill that did not even belong on the check.  So needless to say...I AM NOT COMING BACK TO THIS RESTAURANT AGAIN.
pos	Definitely one of my favorite places to eat hands down.  I love their enchiladas verdes combo.  Their refried beans are THE BEST!  I have been eating here for over 15 years and the waitresses are mostly the same.  Definitely feels like you are at an old friends house when you are there.  Yes it is in a bad area but that hasn't ever deterred me from telling everyone I know that if they want really good real Mexican food at a great price to head down there.  And their green salsa for dipping chips is amazing.
neg	Nasty workers and over priced trash
pos	This is a great QT for when you're driving through Phoenix on I-17. It's right off the freeway so it's perfect for stopping for gas and grabbing a tasty snack.  Plus it's a QuikTrip there isn't really any part of it that isn't awesome.
neg	The portions are too small the plasticware just reminds me of Jack In The Box the serving tray is right from a mall food court and the menu selection is drastically reduced.  You can't really enjoy conversation or relax at lunch listening to the kitchen scream out order numbers to the customers.  The flavor mixing softdrink machine is fun but gimmicky.  The food quality and flavor are the same for the most part but you do leave wanting more...  I won't be returning to this location.
pos	flemings is always top notch. we went for the thursday night wine tasting 20 wines for $25 introducing there new 100 wines by the glass. The selection was good from lite whites to deep reds a great way to sample a portion of there new wine list. then to top it off we received $25 gift cards for dinner. so we stayed and had the AZ resturant week pre fix dinner for $39 the food was wonderful. salads soup lamb chops and filet. i guess to sum it up you can't go wrong with a meal from flemings. they also have a great happy hour.
neg	Cold under done chips. If a Mexican food restaurant can not get this staple right how can I expect them to get much more right.  I arrived for a party that my autocross group was having. Every table had chips and salsa on it. Sombreros were used as the server platters. Senor I don't think this even meets health code.   Dinner was served Buffet Style one of the dishes was called \"fandito.\" I can't think of a less inspired dish. It was simple pasta with some Mexican flavors thrown it a dish that your mother would make if she had leftovers from Mexican Italian nights.   I like really like Mexican food however I left this place hungry as I did not even want to try any of the dishes other than the salad.
pos	I really like this place and I must say it's the best pizza I have had West of Chicago.  The sauce is on the sweet side but I like that.  It's kid friendly so it's a great casual place to be with family and friends without a pretentious side to it.  The lines can be a little long at times but I think it's worth the wait.
neg	This was my second visit to Arriba's and believe me it wasn't my choice. I spent the first 26 years of my life in Southern New Mexico and I miss the food like CRAZY especially green chile. When you walk into Arriba's it's New Mexico this and New Mexico that and the dishes are named after cities and landmarks in the state.  When we told the waitress that in New Mexico green chile sauce doesn't have pork in it she said \"Well we say that but it's not *really* New Mexican\" and walked off. What?!?!  The first time there we mentioned this to a Manager and got the same exact reaction. I also asked if I could get a side of plain green chile and was told no. Both times we were being super nice and just trying to start a friendly conversation had these interactions been better this review wouldn't be here.  I'm far from being a vegetarian I don't eat pork or beef because I don't like it. Also I didn't ask about the red chile sauce because I'm not a fan maybe it's porkless and amazing but I can't speak for that...  I ordered the Santa Fe Chicken salad.  Iceberg lettuce slimy greens cooked onions and bell peppers mushy tomatoes half melted greasy cheese clumps and very dry chicken piled on a shell... yuck.   If it wasn't for the delicious fresh chips guacamole and two 99cent happy hour margaritas I would've been VERY unhappy.  I definitely won't ever be back and this time I mean it.
pos	Green is by far one of my favorite restaurants to eat at.  My husband loves it too and he is a carnivore!  Our favorite things to get are the \"boneless buffalo wings\" and something that another customer shared with me while waiting in line that is not on the menu \"the Wendy's pickle sandwich\" It is amazing!  Another special they have from time to time is \"the big WAC\" and I must say it is better than the real thing!!!!!
neg	Sadly disappointed.  I've passed Lola's an uncountable number of times and each time thought I needed to try it.  I finally did tonight and was terribly disappointed.  For anyone that has been to Firefly in Las Vegas there is just no comparison.  The sangria was decent but nothing special and the tapas were just \"so so.\"  The atmosphere was busy and our service sucked but it was a very unique and cool environment.
pos	This is a must try for any Mani Pedi fan. I use to drive to Scottsdale for all of my services until I found this spot. Get the pedi no metal file pedi once - and you will NEVER go any where else. Have fun. I do..Customer service - top end. Thanks
neg	The reviews were so good that my friend and I had to check it out. We were very disappointed this morning while trying to eat breakfast and swatting tons of flies!!! They were everywhere on us our food the other customers - and this was inside.  The egg sandwiches were served on hamburger buns shaped like rolls - I could have went next door to get one just like it at McDonalds.  Not surprised people from Ahwatukee like this place it looks nice but the food is so-so.
pos	I had the best culinary experience of my 8 years in Phoenix tonight. First time at Switch. Started off with some appetizers; pesto & sun dried tomato risotto marinated chicken breast Mac n cheese. All delicious!    Next my wife orders the blackened salmon. I looked at her with my wtf scowl. We don't even eat seafood. \"It looks interesting\" she says. Whatever. It gets to the table and it's the biggest hunk of salmon I've seen. We simultaneously stab into it with our forks take a bite and we look at each other like the first time we fell in love. The combination of the salmon bacon and sautéed greens was out of this world. Coupled with the bread pudding and sweet tomato concoction put me over the top.   We let the waitress know what we experienced and to thank the chef. She brought him out and he spoke with us for about 15 minutes. Jason is touched by the hand of God. He proceeded to tell us what he had planned for tomorrow's dinner menu and we made reservations on the spot for tomorrow night.   I never knew food could profoundly affect your mood but I was driving home singing my heart out to my iPod. Got home plugged the iPod into the stereo and continued the concert danced with my dog and made me a latte.  Perfect night.    Thank you Jason and Switch.
neg	Let me start by saying after my experience I surly wish they had half or quarter stars and I am not often found with a lack of words but this is going to take some effort to stomach.  Strolled into this establishment at about 1:30 am now to their credit I fully understand the crowd on mill at these hours so I lower my levels of expectations..  Place is moderately busy as we walk in I get to the counter order some pepperoni pizza and a pretzel with 2 drink cups. Second drink cup is forgot after they ran out of the dispenser after I remind him he gets a fresh stock of cups to replenish his dispenser but first takes his hand fingers placed inside the cup and hand me one. Yuck.. Gf didn't catch it so I gave her the first cup and took the lingering finger taste cup as my own.   Fast forward a few minutes guy is in there  his friends are loud and his face is cut wide open from who knows what incident.. He is arguing and finally his friends get him out the door. Now if I ran this place that guy and his yelling and problems would have been asked to stay his hands Nd bloody shirt bumping and squeezing past people was discussing . But.. Let's let that go because it's busy and again this is MIll and it is 2 am..    Fast forward 10 minutes.. Tell the guy the ice machine is out several minutes later.. They fill it.. Again it's busy no big deal on that one and with the high temp in the place maybe it killed on the fingerprint bacteria in my cup while we waited.. \"I'm a wishful thinker\"  Several more minutes go buy of people bustling past smearing nastily cheese wish sandwich wrappers all o over the floor as We walked by \"place was trashed\" I go back up and ask the guy for our order.. He said\" oh sorry forgot\" I was amused but it's just sliced pizza and a pretzel.. He tosses them in the oven and a couple minutes later I get them. Well pizza had obviously been there forever but it was pizza pretzel was hard as a rock and couldn't eat it.   Then the show starts.. there had been a few people in there that obviously knew the gentlemen working the register the flooding actions are the cause for this reviewing of the above..  Short list  -employee is wiping his sweaty face by hand receiving money..then is prepping pizza with topping BY BARE HAND.. Placing it in the oven all with out gloves. This occurs over and over then when his friends arrive there is a round of hand slaps... Um.. Where did these guys come from did they wash their hands? eww.  So in the 45 minutes I am in hereno hand washing no gloves..his hands on food toppings money hands face along with all over surfaces possible. Freaking DISGUSTING.  But it gets better.. His friends that he is conversing with are about to ice the cake..  One of them this red headed guy is reaching behind the counter near the pick up and grabbing fries out of the Bin with his hands.. This happens no less than 10 times..  Another one ask his to meet them in the bathroom... Um what? Yes.. That locked bathroom father 1 am that is closed off to customers.. Hmm my imagination can only wonder what brief activity occurred in the restroom. could my dazed and non health conscious server and front man for this business also be doing drug's one can only speculate. His actions after reflected a very relaxed and dazed person.  Where I will give this guy a couple points is end of the night he started picking up the place as it had slowed well this obviously is his job and they have to clean up at the end of the night anyways..but was surprised at this point.   At this point and my food not eaten we are done being entertained by watching all this and he asked to take our plate at which time he noticed I didn't eat much. He asked if the pretzel was not good and I choose this time to politely tell him the reasons above as why we didn't finish.   He took it in stride with no attitude but said simply they got busy and backed up. I do appreciate that but honestly there is ZERO excuse for even a small percentage of the actions to have taken place. I see this as a health risk and was more comfortable at taco stands in Mexico than this establishment.     In short I'll be contacting the owner of this location.   I do realize this is a late night food offering I do realize the clientele but I also know this is unacceptable and some poor guy who is mismanaging this place needs a wake up call.   I will be back very soon if anything just to see if changes are made after I voice my concerns. If needed ill be happy to forward my videos to the county health inspector.   -Thanks for reading this little novel.
pos	New to the Scottsdale area I've been searching for a nail salon for a few weeks. I stumbled upon this place and was very happy. Although it's in a weird strip mall it's really relaxing inside. My gel manicure was perfect and the shoulder massage was a nice added extra! Totally recommend!
neg	Rude rude rude. I will *never* go back to this place. I don't normally carry cash and when I went to pick up my son's pants for his recital that night I was in a little bit of a jam (they only take cash or checks). When I suggested they might put this on the claim ticket or at least mention it when people drop off their clothes the owner pointed to an itty bitty sign and told me \"we have signs everywhere.\" The owner was hostile and argumentative and just didn't care about what I had to say. Then he hovered over me while my son tried his pants on like I was going to steal something (the place is TINY). I went to an ATM and pulled out cash it wasn't that big of a deal but this place has no customer service skills whatsoever. I won't ever go there again. Steer clear.
pos	The pizza is incredible they use really high quality ingredients and the prices are great. I would recommend cooking it on the bottom rack of your oven for a slightly better texture on the crust.  I want someone to mark that this post is funny so I will add a joke:  Mushroom walks into a bar... Bartender says \"sorry we don't serve your type here.\" Mushroom says \"why not? I'm a fungi (fun guy).\"
neg	The Vine Tavern (i'll omit the word Eatery as i'm fairly certain this term can't be applied to the food they serve at this establishment) is a vortex sort of culmination hang-out for low-brow Fred Durst clones and future (day-shift) strippers. With that being said this cesspool of a building hasn't burned to the ground yet so I feel compelled to warn others before they consider spending an evening there.  Being new to the Tempe area myself and a small group of friends decided to drop in to check it out.  As we approached the-dimly lit building I began to have second thoughts: my bloomy sense was tingling (more on this later). As we entered we were greeted by a lovely bouncer type gentlemen who begged us to pay the 5$ cover.... seriously. We were seated towards the back near a group of teenage mothers and their burly counterparts. We ordered food...  The food arrived in a timely manner it may have been poisoned but i was too hungry to care. I ordered the mushroom/swiss burger.... 9 dollars-ish. If Mcdonalds ever begins selling their products in the frozen food aisle of grocery stores it might taste something like what they serve at The Vine. I had immediate food regret my only consolation was the 1$ you call its and the poor old man behind the mic with his acoustic guitar wrapping up his set. Surreal. .. . .We regrettably paid and escaped out the back.   Good: Cheap Drinks !!!!   Bad: You may be stabbed!!!
pos	RIP AZ Coffee Connection.  :(  I stopped by two days ago unaware that they had closed.  I am severely bummed.  This place is irreplaceable!  Damn you Starbucks and McDonalds!
neg	Honestly the drinks are overpriced and have a hint of rubbing alcohol Honestly my lunch was just okay Honestly they have a drink called the stigmata Honestly I am dreading having to give them 2 stars given the hype  But I am supposed to be honest.  This place has been the buzz since before I returned stateside. My coworkers had also been hearing the same buzz. We just had to go as the finale to our week of lunch. Yeah I probably would've been better off at the Billet Bar across the street. I mean it is biker week. The people watching would've been stellar. The only people watching I had at RnR was the gorgeous server outside our window on the patio. But even his piece of art body won't bring me back.  The first hint should've really been the overpriced drinks we started with. I figured for that price they should be damn good so I ordered some lime concoction. A coworker got the stigmata. Holy strong... and not in a good way. I mean I appreciate my drink as much as the next but not when I can't even enjoy it.   One of my other coworkers on the other hand was enjoying his blue moon. That was until he held it up to take another sip and the entire bottom of his glass fell off.. yes.. fell in one piece.. onto our table. What happened to the contents do you ask? That went all over him the table inside someone's wallet and onto an iPhone and my face. The waiter wasn't even really apologetic about it aside from giving us some extra cloth napkins which weren't soaking anything up at all. No wet rag no comp no apology nothing but another glass of blue moon we were hoping wasn't bought at a prank store and a sticky table faces and sunglasses.  The chicken lollipops were not what I expected but really weren't bad. I did enjoy those. I also enjoyed the presentation of my fries. Cute silver bucket. Tons of fries. Couldn't finish.  I ended up getting a chicken sandwich that had brie and some other goodness on it. Totally forgot to order it without tomato but I picked it off easily.   I know what you're thinking they serve breakfast here til 2pm why the hell did the breakfast queen not order breakfast. Honestly none of it wooed me enough that it looked delicious. They had a make your own omelet that was on my short list of things to order but I'm glad I didn't after seeing a coworker's tiny ass omelet and bread with no other side for $10. Also I highly doubt their Amish french toast is all that Amish. Just sayin'. I know a bit or two about Amish goodness.  So back to my lunch.. it was just eh which was sad. The description sounded so delicious I really was expecting to be wowed.. finally.. after all the mishaps I'd had up until this point. I do admit I loved the bread. It was delicious. I also appreciated that despite them not having honey mustard aioli or anything else to dip my fries in aside from ketchup and barbeque sauce (which was given with the sweet potato fries.. ew) they tried to make me honey mustard. Unfortunately it was just honey mixed in with bottle mustard ketchup. I ended up using the ranch dressing from the lollipops.   What I paid for this was ridiculous. The way they reacted to the beer mishap was ridiculous. The food was meh. Not even I was tempted to try breakfast there. It was like the beautiful model that has no brains.... and I want some brain thought going into my dining experience. Don't try to woo me with simple sex appeal.  One of my coworkers commented that maybe in 6 months when the pans are seasoned well after being used the place will be worth it to try again. I told him maybe.  Had to edit that someone from our table got terribly ill too... oy vey!
pos	I am ready to update you to a five because the last three times I have been there your service has been better the huevos rancheros has been consistently perfect I have never had to wait for a seat at the bar and I want to hug the cute new bartender because she is quirkily cute!!   If you were still serving breakfast at 6pm I would come eat you now.
neg	The only reason 1 star can be given is the flavor choices and taste.  The SMALLEST wings I have ever seen they must be off of baby chicks.  I thought it was getting punked actually LOL.  Never to be back
pos	I have passed this place for 20 years and had always heard good things. Well one night when we were kidless we went. It was pricier that we thought but we forgot the price once the meals arrived. We were both very impressed. Warm homemade bread. Awesome salads. I tried the escolar (it's a fish that a friend of mine loved but I had never tried it) and it absolutely melted in my mouth. My husband enjoyed his sausage and peppers. We will definitely go back!
neg	I have so many friends that love this chain but I'm not a fan. I've eaten at different locations across different states but always end up sick. I think that I must be allergic to a seasoning that they apply to everything. I've gotten sick from salad pasta to steaks. Needless to say if a friend wants to eat dinner here it's tea or water only for me.
pos	Once again Wildflower proves why it's my favorite breakfast hangout! Jeff the Manager on staff today rocks!   Some of us hangout at a restaurant to make it a working meal...and sometimes during that time Nature calls...so I asked the busboy to not clear my table as I needed to step away for a moment and he cheerfully agreed. I came back to find my table cleared by new patrons who had taken it upon themselves to steal my table (I guess the fact that the food was only half eaten and the water and coffee were still half filled were no clue). The busboy was upset that he'd turned his back for just a moment and Jeff came to the rescue...after apologizing to me and finding the perfect way to make it right he vowed to let the new people know that they were rather um 'overly proactive' in clearing the table themselves and that he had some people who regularly relaxed and worked in the restaurant and do step away.  He handled the situation with me just right and I am sure that those people that took my table were made to gently understand that they need to ask before taking an uncleared table.  Kudos to Jeff and the staff for making me so happy I had to tell everyone here...and to the couple who took my table if you are reading this...did you REALLY need that booth? I mean when I came out of the can there were like I dunno 5 empty tables...seriously? Like did you propose there or something????
neg	This is the closest to a New York hipster style coffee shop I've seen in Arizona.  They serve beer too.  Problem is that the espresso was unbelievably bitter.  Cookie happy hour is pretty cool though.
pos	There are no words to express the value of the quality of service that you receive from  Tina Yragui's Hands 4 Healing  therapeutic overall body care.  The value  of knowledge of the body the commitment of service the excellence of research for each individual client. The degree that she possesses cannot be measured with a dollar amount because no dollar amount can beat this value. It is value what goes far beyond what you receive each and every time you see Tina.    Tina is a healer and is dedicated to you.   It just doesn't get any better!

neg	Great at first then the bartender ignored me and my friends for a good 20-30 minutes put everyones bill on my tab. I opened a tab so this wouldn't happen then they made us wait another 15 for them just to ask us who had what. Then they over charged us by quit a bit. We had to flag someone f=down from napkins and plates and it took a few try's for a water. And to make matters worse my friend got a parking ticket because they took so long. There were three bartenders for what I handle myself at a bar on a daily basis. No sorry from any of them and not even a drip of regret from the manager. He pretty much told us to chill out after this whole 45 min waiting or deal just to close a check. Kind of a joke really.
pos	I have been here many times pretty much can't go wrong here. prices are good service is prompt and friendly.
neg	This dog park gets one star.Why?Because the last time I wentsome piece of shit broke into just about every car in the parking lot to steal whatever they could.So much broken glass from side windows everywhere. It used to be okay before this incidentbut a busy parking lot in borad daylight and some vulture lies in wait? YeahI'm done here.
pos	As an artist I've come to be very picky about the stores from which I purchase my art supplies. Arizona Art Supply is a GREAT store!!! Every time I visit I overhear the staff's experienced recommendations; they take the time to ensure that every customer's needs are satisfied.   I am always immediately welcomed as I delve into the fully stocked and well-organized aisles. Yes this is my kind of art supply store!  As I browse the expansive selection of everything from  drawing supplies to paint easels and canvases to ceramic tools an overwheming desire to create comes over me. AZ Art Supply has a HUGE selection of my favorite brands--Prismacolor and Golden Paints!    Although this store is smaller the prices are reasonable--they beat out Michael's prices for nearly every item. If you're looking for exceptional quality a diverse selection and a knowledgeable staff Arizona Art Supply is your best bet.
neg	I just had the ice cream. That was when I didn't know where to go for ice cream. It tasted artificial much like how everything else looked. There was also a weird feeling about the place - too self-consciously \"cute\"  suspension of reality - almost as if a crime was imminent like a bad TV show. Looking at the rest of the food was almost disturbing - like school cafeteria food only worse. Oh well it discouraged me from eating anything the whole rest of the day.
pos	So yummy in my tummy. My sister and I went here for dinner and the food was as always-- very yummy. We had the marinated BBQ pork and the seafood hot pot at hot. We finished half the of the plates because they give you a lot. It would be better of the price wasn't as pricey. But overall awesome service and yummy food! We will be back!!  They first serve you lil condiment plates from seaweed to kimchi (spicy marinated cabbage that has been fermentated). When they serve you your food they will ask if you want egg in the soup-- of course!!! They crack it in front of you in the sizzling hot soup...drools. Serving you some extra rice for the soup and pork. We had to pack to go boxes because it was a lot of food.   Today we went again for Father's Day and our family agreed this was so yummy. We had the BBQ pork again with Dumpling Tofu soup (\"Yum-O\" Rachael Ray) and Bibimbap with rice! The Bibimbap was okay but everything was excellent. Our family of five finished nearly everything. :D so GOOOOOD! Going to come back soon!   Check this place out!
neg	If you like the stuck up Scottsdale vibe this is a good place for you. The food isn't impressive. Nice outdoor seating.
pos	LOVE the food!!!!
neg	This Jack in the Box location has the worst service & food that I have found in the Phoenix metro area. Every time I have gone through the drive through there my order has either been wrong or inedible - how hard is it to make a taco without frying it into oblivion? The wait times are consistently more than 5 minutes...I think I will be spending that 5 minutes driving to another location just to get the correct order & food that is properly prepared.
pos	I am a huge Suns fan but my review is about the fundraising options that the Suns have to offer as well as their back-office staff.  First and foremost talk about a professional classy organization. Whether you have fundraising experience or are a total novice the staff treats you like you are the only group they are working with. My contact is Kyle Pottinger and he is always a gentleman. No matter what questions I have he always answers them promptly and never makes me feel like I'm bothering him.   The fundraising process is easy and the tickets practically sell themselves because who doesn't want the chance to purchase discounted tickets?   The process is easy and the rewards can be lucrative depending on the target audience you are working with. The Suns will treat you professionally and courteously. You won't be disappointed.
neg	Got a padi and the tech stopped for a while to eat. then i got a new tech to finish my pedi. my total was different than the quoted price. when paying my total was $25 i hanede them a $50 and they cashier tried to keep all the change for a tip. he refused to give me my change until i told him that is not gon to happen. My feet were so dry afterwards. I DO NOT recommend them
pos	These guys helped me out with my rear windshield wiper.  They could have just shrugged their shoulders and said they didn't have the part but they worked with me and tried a couple of different options until we found a solution.  Everyone I encountered was great.
neg	I purchased a pair of Naot Paris sandals ($160 with tax) at The Shoe Mill.  I considered buying on-line but decided to shop locally instead.  I ended up paying more but assumed that I was paying for the superior service.  I wore my new shoes to work on Friday.  By the end of the day I had developed blisters on both feet near my toes and my ankles.  I was surprised because I had read many reviews stating how comfortable Naot sandals are and the salesman who helped me confirmed that I was buying the correct size.  Sadly I took them back to the store the next day.  To my surprise I was told that The Shoe Mill does not take returns.  I have never tried to return shoes so it didn't occur to me to ask this question when I made the purchase.  However as I stated I expected full service from a high end shoe store. I will no longer shop at The Shoe Mill.  It's been three days and my feet are still recovering.  It's a constant reminder of how dissatisfied I was with my purchase.  I will definitely shop Zappos next time.
pos	Eating in is a decent experience but for delivery I have yet to meet their match.  When I order delivery I always get a 16\" chicken pizza with alfredo sauce on top and for the last 6 years I have received it in 30 minutes or less all but 2 times.  Its always tasty fresh and is my preeminent food for delivery ever period.
neg	Once again THE TROUGH SLURPERS offer far too many stars to this mundane eatery proving again that they are truly CANAILLE of the first order.: Slow indifferent service Mediocre food The kind of wine that patrons of kokopelli swill with delight calling it ambrosia when it's actually dishwater. But..as with Kokopelli it keeps the shit eaters out of the better restaurants! So I say to you canaille..flock flock there with your disruptive screaming children and your leathery palates.
pos	I love boba drinks but hate the word \"boba\". I always feel like an ape when I say that word.    Anyways.  There was a period where I use to drink this stuff at least 3 times a week when I was living in San Francisco so when I say I love something I really do (or is it more like a creepy obsession?) So! When I found a boba place here I got excited especially when I saw that they had green milk tea.  I can't vouch for all of their drinks as I've only tried the green milk tea and avocado snow but every time I have ordered them they have been super good.
neg	I used to go here at least 3 times a week for Happy hour.  The volcano chicken was my favorite meal.  However the last time I was in there I had a cricket in my water.  I took a sip squeezed the lemon and thought there was something wrong with the taste.  I checked and at first thought it was a lemon seed but no sure enough it was a cricket (in which i took a picture).  The way this restaurant handled an insect in my water was repulsive.  One of the male bartenders came over and brought a new water saying \"It happens.\"  No sorry that's disgusting.  If i hadn't been craving the volcano chicken I went there for I would have just left.  And then on top of getting a cricket in my water there's no discount or compensation off of my bill.
pos	I found Cake Frenzy through an service listing on Craigslist while looking for someone to create our wedding cake/cupcakes. Not only were we on a tight budget we only had about 2 1/2 months to plan for the venue we wanted only had a few dates available. I met Jennifer about a month prior my fiance' and I knew we wanted a peanut butter & jelly cake and she happily obliged. I emailed her a picture of what I wanted and the day of our wedding when I first saw our cake I almost cried. She went above and beyond my expectations. The cake was beautiful with sugar flowers and gelatin butterflies. All of our guests loved the flavor combinations and the decorations. I highly recommend Cake Frenzy she is professional she takes pride in her work and extremely reasonable.
neg	I went here with Friends last Friday.  All my friends and I use Yelp at the end of the meal taking cost into perspective we all came to this is a 1 star place.  It was a huge disappointment after looking at the positive reviews.  Our 1st disappointment came because they had a \"limited\" beer list.  My good buddy just wanted an IPA and all they had was the normal domestic beers and a few other quality ones.  Then the Spanish ham was not very good and once you take into account the price it was terrible.  We had a sausage plate where the sausage was dry.  The Calamari was extremely oily.  The only positive thing was the lamb chops but once you factor in price that was poor too.  We all came to the conclusion we would never go back.
pos	Love it.  Last night I dropped into Romanelli's for the first time after driving past a time or two.  Glad I did.  It's a bakery and deli that offers a fine selections of meats cheeses and breads.  They also sell all things culinary Italia.    When I stopped in it was 30-40 minutes to close.  I went directly to the deli counter for a sub and was met with a challenge as I decided which to try.  I opted for George's Special (ham capicolla salami mortadella pepperoni provolone and hot peppers).  Given the close proximity to closing time I was expecting a sub on older bread that had been sitting around all day but it was still soft and very fresh.  The sub is easily the best I've had.  Amazing.  I also purchased a cannoli.  I'm picky about these things.  Too many places fill 'em and stock 'em and the filling makes the shell soggy.  Romanelli's fills them upon order just like the Italian bakery near a friends house in Newark NJ (until last night the best cannoli I've had).  The cannoli was top notch.  Simply the best.  Right here in Phoenix on one night I had one of the best meals ever.  I cannot wait to return.  I only open they were open past 6pm.
neg	OVERPRICED & DECEITFUL & RUDE!  I should have read the reviews before I came here! I took a bridesmaid dress in to have the top taken in like 1/4 inch not much. I asked her how much will this cost? She assured me it would not be \"much\". It was $60 and she hardly did a thing can't even steam it there. I was irate but calmly asked her if she could charge less and she screamed NO! She said it's because the dress cost more. Yeah...like that matters A guy was there dropping off pants that needed taken OUT which is a lot more work she charge him $18.50 for each pair. I don't know if that is good for pants a lot but her pricing scale seems way off!  Previously I've been to 5th Avenue Alterations and they charge me $50 for a floor length brdiesmaid dress that they took in the whole thing AND steamed it. They're also polite and will work with you on pricing and communicate with you beforehand. Definitely worth the few extra minutes of a drive!!
pos	My Fiance and I went here today for the first time. We shared a meat pie and a serving of the largest  Bosnian Sausage dish.       ALL of it was amazing. I cannot speak highly enough of their food. Service was very prompt and the waitress courteous and quick. The food was very reasonably priced and the restaurant itself was very charming and nicely decorated. All over the ambiance was pleasant. I look forward to returning!
neg	Buca Di Beppo is literally italian restaurant hell. You know how all big box chain restaurants throw junk up on the walls in an attempt to make the space feel vintage? Buca Di Beppo throws junk and knick knacks and statues and anything else 'italian' they could find in the chinese warehouse where they loaded up these goods. It's a terrible horrible mess and you end up sitting in a yardsale of italian paraphenalia while eating your very bland pasta.   It's embarassing how truly flavorless the food is here. Thin flavorless alfredo sauce. Thick slabs of lasagna with less taste than what I can get out of the frozen section at Publix. I went with a large group and across the table bland food.  When they seat your party they guide you through the kitchen area where the cooks play along and say a welcoming hello. Deep down you know they hate this. Why are we in the kitchen? Sure it's nice but I'd rather have them concentrating on making the food and making it good. Of course the food at Buca Di Beppo seems to be far beyond any point of return to tasting good. It's just dead. Dead food. No life no flavor not emotion. I get more flavor from the $.99 Michelina's frozen lunch package.  Far from claiming anything authentic Italian Buca Di Beppo even pumps out bread with no taste. Eating at Buca is like eating food from an assisted living facility. No salt no sugar no butter no fat it's all gone along with anything resembling taste. Sure Buca has huge portions and the setup is nice for large parties and families - but they might as well just buy the family-size pasta packs from the frozen section and bake it at home even that would be better and they wouldn't have to the mandatory gratuity. Say what you will about other italian chains like Macaroni Grill or Olive Garden - at least their food taste like something.
pos	Buckle is a really cool store.  They carry both men and women's clothing and they have a huge selection of jeans.  From Silver to Lucky they're all there!    They also have really cute tops- from casual to dressier ones you could wear out to a club or bar.  It's nice because this store has its own style...kinda casual a little funky but definitely different than anything you'd find at Macy's or Nordstrom's.    They also carry some shoes and accessories and the staff is really helpful.  You'll also get a little punch card with your first purchase and after so many punches you'll get $10 or $15 off.  The clothes range in price but generally I'd say everything in the store is pretty reasonable.  This location is in Paradise Valley Mall- check it out!
neg	I want to like this place as it is in the neighborhood and there aren't many other options around here but this is probably the worst restaurant/bar I've ever had the misfortune of going to.   My last trip I sat down to order a beer at the bar.  The bartender takes about five minutes to get me a beer despite the bar being nearly empty as he was too busy for me with his time and focus instead spent flirting with one of the servers.    I drink my beer and want another.  The glass sits empty for about five minutes while he paces around the bar.  I try on three occasions to get his attention and ask for another.  The dude is just ignoring me at this point.  I guess they don't want my business and I just leave.  He can have the 8 cents he owes me in change for a tip... I just want out of here.  I feel bad when I leave that he even got the 8 cents from me.  I hope he spends it well.  On other trips here my wife and I have had the food.  It's not any better than the service sadly.  I have an English Bulldog at home with a poop eating problem and I'm not sure he would even find this food acceptable.  Overall just the worst restaurant around and it's no surprise why the place always looks so dead out front.  Nobody's there because it's simply horrible.  Avoid at all cost.  I wouldn't eat here again but would give the bar another shot if I heard the replaced all the help.  Whoever owns this place needs to clean house.  Looking at other reviews on here I see I'm not alone in my feelings about the service.  Get rid of these people already... just sad!!
pos	Like others I found this studio through a Living Social coupon.  It is a great studio.  Kim is so friendly and fun.  I would highly recommend the yoga classes.  They are both challenging and relaxing!  It is a small studio but that gives it a really nice intimate feel.  I definitely recommend it!
neg	D-scust-ing.
pos	I freakin love this place. My favorite thing is to sit and eat facing the counter and watch new people come in and get all confused. Now that's just funny. My first time I was the same way like what the hell do I do here. Now I'm a pro. Stack it deep and use another bowl for smashing Soba noodles piled so high it looks like a circus act getting the bowl to the cook. Mmmm....good.
neg	Walk the other way just walk right the hell the other way...  Here was how this played out.  Oktoberfest a few days ago.  Starting the night off.  I walk past this place and see a place that sells a slice of pizza for $1.99.  Good right?  No.    me: \"Hi one slice of pizza please\" guy: \"you buy drink with it 4 dollars.\" me: \"no just one slice of pizza\" guy: \"we do not sell one slice you have to buy a drink.  4 dollars\"  I should have pulled a flag on this play at this point but knowing I was going to be drinking I move forward wanting food in me. Not a wise move.  me: \"so I can't buy one slice?\" guy: \"no you buy a drink with slice 4 dollars.\" me: \"It doesn't say that anywhere on the menu or walls\" guy: \"No do not sell one slice. me: \"what the... O.K. give me 2 slices of pizza\" guy: \"you buy two slices then.\" me: \"yes Jesus Christ yes\" guy: \"toppings?\" me: \"no no toppings.  cheese.\" guy: \"we have toppings.\"  what is this guy fucking deaf?   me: \"no thanks\"  I give him the money.  guy: \"it take 10 minutes you wait.\"  I don't think they run the air conditioner in this place so I wait outside.  Pizza comes out.  Tastes like absolute crap.  I eat it outside because in September in Chandler Arizona it is cooler outside then inside this place.  I think they had the thermostat set to \"HELL\" Guy working or running the place comes outside and stares me down as I am eating.  I'm sure if you want to eat here you can check the dumpster for plenty of slices to try beforehand to avoid having to pay for one.  Excuse me avoid having to pay for two.  However after what I had served to me I'm pretty sure they will beat you to the garbage cans and sell it back to some other unsuspecting soul.  I was the only one dumb enough to finish all the food.  Wouldn't eat here if there was a natural disaster and this place was the last to be ransacked for provisions.  I'd keep walking.  FAIL.
pos	If you want to go back to the future at the movie theater Silver Cinemas is the place for you- I felt like I was in the 1980- the decor LITTERALLY says it all.. I kid you not I am as frugle as the come and you get & more than you pay for here -($3.00 everyday except for tuesdays $1.50) have I mentioned the minnie arcade? Epic place to relive your childhood on date after drinks next door ...
neg	I love how all other Yelpers reviewing this company have discovered the same issues that would never permit me to use their services again. Company is a disaster and should be reported to the BBB.
pos	Until Bobby Q's entered my life i wasnt a fan of BBQ anything! made me kinda sad to see so many people enjoying some messy ribs but anyways I i digress...This place has changed my life for the better!. Their St. Louis ribs are fall off the bone AMAZING! and their Mac n Cheese is a must have! I have to admit this place has made me a bit of a ribs snob if something doesnt come close to Bobby Q's i automatically right that place off.  A short review but you get the gist of it...
neg	if you like terrible service and overpriced food you've come to the right place.  If I knew before I went in there I would be paying $16.00 for macaroni and cheese and had the pleasure of waiting around for an hour to get it while my glass remained empty I would've stayed away (which is what you should do).  Food wasn't awful although 2 members of the party did cut up their mouths eating the hard as a \"Rock\" bread on their sandwiches. The mac n' cheese was nothing special.  The service was beyond poor.  First and last time I will eat at Hard Rock Cafe.
pos	WOW this place is good!  SO good!  And not just yummy good but intrinsically good.  Check out their amazing list of environmentally responsible business practices - http://essencebakery.com/essence_bakery_environmentally_friendly.shtml !    That and it's cute.  And it tastes Yummy!  And they are SO nice!  SOOO nice!  And their deserts are just disgustingly cute and beautiful and freaking good.  I almost bought the mini box of 4 cupcakes for just $3.50.  Bite sized so not too bad but if I bought them today they'd be gone before I got home.   I got their grilled cheese w/ mozzarella basil and tomato on grilled buttery brioche bread with a light and tasty green salad on the side.  It will be hard to not come here every week.  I love that all the drinks are refillable - and it's up to you to refill them.  Coffee tea or soda just walk on up and fill your glass.  And I love that it's all so fresh and local!    Important note - You order at the counter they give you a number and bring out your food.  If you're paying w/ debit card they will ask you if you want to include a tip.  That threw me.  I'd been in the place less than 2 minutes - how do I know if it's worth the tip - or how much of a tip it's worth??  Bring some cash or plan to deal w/ that question accordingly.
neg	Mediocre bland low quality food topped off with painfully slow service.  I worked in the neighborhood and continued to return occasionally \"just in case it's gotten better\" for reasons I could never fathom once the plate of abysmal food was placed on the table.  The salsa and rice are usually good but that's the most I have to offer.
pos	What a cool little place tucked away behind a strip mall.  Would never have found this if it was not suggested by a good friend who raved about the cappuccino!  He is world traveler so it's a  must try if it's the best cup he's ever had.  He was right!  Don't know if it's in the beans or the care that they take to make it with a fab froth decoration on top.  My hubby and I loved the caramel brulee taste..  My son loved the hot \"warm\" cocoa.  Yeah we walked in as a family last night and almost everyone turned our way since we did not fit the hip college crowd.  Everyone was really friendly though. The sweet young man behind the counter gave my son some micro cinnamon doughnuts and scored major points with the little dude!   We will be back.
neg	Prices are often way too high!
pos	Love it!!! Wish we still lived in Arizona as Chino is the one thing we miss. Every time I think about Chino Bandido my mouth starts watering. If I am ever in the state again I will drive out of my way just to go to it again. YUMMY!
neg	I brought my sweet sister in law shopping at this Forever 21 location.  She had a bag full of goodies (several hundreds of dollars worth) from H&M.  She stopped at Forever 21 and  sat her bag on the ground right beside her while she tried on a pair of shoes.  Her H&M bag was stolen during that brief moment that the bag was not in her arms.....and while this certainly was not the responsibility of Forever 21....we were so disappointed in the way the Forever 21 staff reacted. They did not call security or the police or even offer any condolences.  They just shrugged their shoulders.  My sister in law did love some of the fashions at Forever 21....but the store was such a mess.  There were clothes all over the floor under each and every rack.  There were way too few staff members working and many who were working were \"socializing\" with one another instead of helping customers or maintaining the store inventory in a decent fashion. The only employees that were on task were:  1 at the checkout and 1 at the fitting rooms - there was a band of 5 girls dressing one mannequin while the store was amidst in chaos (including someone stealing bags from other customers)..... So - if you choose to shop at this store - hold on to your bags :)
pos	I lived off Salazar Bros my first year of college because I lived right near it.  Must have eaten there twice a week minimum.  I was heartbroken when it turned into Armando Bros because as much as people told me they just changed their name they didn't.  It was a different restaurant.    I had written it off as another great place gone to the pages of history until I moved near 48th and Baseline and 'lo and behold there was Salazar's tucked away in the Fry's parking lot next to a Little Caesars and a clothing outlet that appears to have escaped from the mall.    The interior itself is cheaply thrown together and completely forgettable.  The only thing the employees seem to care about is making food.  And none of this bothers me because they make some damn amazing food for cheap prices.  I recommend the adobada burrito with extra sour cream and 2 things of red sauce.  It's pork brushed with a delicious sauce of some sort.  Comes with pico and guacamole.  I sometimes have to convince myself to try something new off the menu.  Brownie points for carrying Pepsi products as well I take Mountain Dew with my burritos.
neg	The absolute worse service I've encountered. My boyfriend son and I sat at a tepan table we were ignored for a good 15-20 minutes until my boyfriend had to ask the manager to please have someone get us something to drink. Once we had our drinks it took another 20 minutes to order our food. By that time another family sat at our table. My son & boyfriend ordered a meal from the tepan menu I had sushi. Everyone on that table got their meal and I still didn't get my sushi. I asked the server to please bring it and she brought someone else's order I had to wait another 20 minutes for my sushi. The family on our table were so upset for us as well.   The food is excellent the service is so poor I am disappointed. I advise anyone who comes here to sit at the sushi bar and deal with the Chefs they are great. I talked to the owner and she was just as bad as the servers.   I then gave it another try. I met my girlfriends there. We had dinner spent over $200. We then moved over to the bar area and were completely forgotten about. We asked the manager/owner to please have someone come take care of us and we were told that they were concerned because we were drinking and had kids with us. One of my girlfriends had her kids but she was not drinking. I was offended that she tried to cover up the poor service with her so-called concern.   Again food is great service is lousy. I am so disappointed and will not go back. I will look elsewhere for my Caliente Rolls. I hear Blu at the Wigwam is really good and servers are hospitable.
pos	I have now visited Herb n' Flavors several times. I love supporting local businesses who have sustainable practices. This place uses local farms for their produce safe from GMO's and pesticides. So I was already a fan before I walked in! Everything I have tried has been delicious and the owner is such a cool guy- always so friendly to the customers. The food always tastes so fresh and full of flavor! They have a little something for everyone. I am a gluten free vegan and my husband has no dietary restrictions. We always both leave happy. I definitely recommend this place. I would like to see their business continue to grow and stick around for a long time! :)
neg	Sadly with new owners comes changes on menu.  My fav Barbecue chicken salad no longer has a hint of the same taste. It should now be called flavor of tomato.   Also sad to find out that the most outstanding veggie sandwich now tastes like it comes from another country. Again not a single hint of similarity of same flavor. Im sure many people will love these new changes.  Yet Im sad it's not the same. I woke up today dreaming about the old veggie sandwich! No joking!!!!!!!!!
pos	Tried them out for Restaurant Week.  The food and service was excellent.  I will certainly be back and loved the atmosphere. We sat at a booth and very comfortably sat 3 adults.  The wait staff was non stop on refilling drinks bringing more bread making sure the food was cooked to order.
neg	This place is closed.  Good riddance.
pos	It does not get much better than this fellas.  BS West is hands down the best gay bar in Phoenix.  Friendly bartenders cheap drinks good-looking crowd great music..it's definitely got it all.  Best night to check out is the obvious 2-4-1 Wednesday.   Thursdays and Sundays can also be fun if you're into karaoke. Saturdays are a nice alternative if you don't really dig Forbidden or Amsterdam it's a different crowd.  It definitely has a \"Cheers\" feeling to it... not pretentious whatsoever. Great patios too especially the back one with the new video screen they installed.  Oh and their Halloween bash is THE party to be at. 3000 people attended in 2007.
neg	Bad shop rude owners. Pro-tip: If you want to \"enhance\" the Phoenix community you could start by not playing music loudly when it's obvious that there are musicians trying to perform their sets that people paid to see at the well-respected venue next door.
pos	I really like this place alot. their pizza's are really different but really good! I wish i could say i had a favorite but ive liked every pizza ive gotten except the portabello mushrooms cause i dont like mushrooms but other than that they have an amazing beer selection! Major thumbs up!!
neg	Pure Fitness as a whole I like. No contracts the people going there are actually there to work out and not to be seen (ex. LA Fitness). Plus you get complimentary training sessions. However this location I will NEVER return to and its all because of their new GM Adam. I had a free pass and he was the one that I had been assigned to for my fitness test and 1st training session. I had already explained that I planned to join but he wouldn't stop the full court press of selling which I didnt like at all. I wanted to use my weeks free pass THEN join. He wanted me to give him money right then and there when he hadnt so much as given me a tour yet! Anyway I told him I wanted to wait and then he starts asking when I get paid is it a money situation etc..if made me VERY uncomfortable.   I went ahead with the training session and he knew in advance that Im not inactive but going to the gym is not something Ive done on a consistent basis in a very long time. Now I enjoyed the workout but from what others have told me..he pushed me way to hard for my first time out of the gate. My arms weren't sore I know sore Im okay with sore but they became weak for FIVE days that I had trouble sleeping they had that irritable and restless feeling and it hurt to use a freakin' date stamp at work!   But the reason Im not going back..I was surfing them online and saw how easy it was to sign up online so I did. That way I wouldnt have to worry about remembering voided checks etc.  Well I called Adam to let him know and he went off on me.. just short of yelling. \"Great now I lose the commission the gym loses the points.. you can understand why Im upset right.\" and he went on for about 5 minutes. I was stunned at how unprofessional he was and he's the GM??? If they work on commission they should give you a heads up \"hey I know its easy to sign up online but we work on commission so I would appreciate it if you went through me if and when you choose to sign up\". I would have respected that. OR if when you sign up online it allows you to put in the name of the person you have been working with so it doesn't circumvent them. But I was floored and pissed that he came at me like that.   Ps. Of all the Pure Fitness this one is the smallest visually unappealing and has the worst customer service. I did sign up and I love the one I go to now...but this one I will never step foot in again
pos	Sportsman's is on top of the game when it comes to wine! The staff is more knowledgeable and helpful than any other place that I have bought wine at before. I didn't feel like I was being judged for trying to find a cheaper bottle and there was no pretentiousness in the air. While I was inquiring about dry resling one of the vino gurus offered to get me a taste of one from their bar - and came back with TWO samples for me to try!   Sportsman's also has a very intriguing liquor section - I enjoy wandering around and looking at all the fabulous bottles I have never seen nor heard of.   Several times a month they offer complimentary wine tastings and special discounts on most of the bottles being sampled.  They also have a full service restaurant/bar off to the side where they have a huge \"by the glass\" list - you are also welcome to pick out any bottle from their store they cork it free of charge and you can enjoy your retail priced bottle with dinner!    The portabello sliders that I had for dinner were amazing and I am still having dreams about them!   My one complaint is petty: their website.  Its overrun with text and finding important information is difficult it also needs to be better updated with their amazing tasting events!
neg	Easily the worst \"burrito\" I have ever had. It amazes my that anyone would choose to eat at this chain. I bet the rations they serve from the back of UN trucks to refugees is better.
pos	Alright went back last night felt bad because we were the late nighters and everything was perfect.  The pizza the salads and the wine were all so well done.  And what finally brought me to five stars was the crepe with Nuteila and Mascarpone.  OMG amazing.  I'm currently craving it the day after.  Totally beats out the crepe with nutella and banana that I also love...
neg	Refused to give water to young teen & referred her to PF Changs.  Olive & Ivy handled this poorly unprofessionally & pathetically.   PF Changs didn't even hesitate to give her the water.  That's why I ate there instead.
pos	I love supporting local coffee houses and this one is my favorite.  They are always super friendly even if I sit in there for hours studying and only order one drink.  I LOVE their sugar free avalanches!
neg	We found a bandaid with the panang.  We ordered panang with chicken not panang with bandaid.   When we told the waiter he argued that it wasn't a bandaid.  I'm sorry there's no mistaking a bandaid!  The icing on the cake was that they charged us for it!!!  If you like bandaid on your dish this I the place to go!  Too bad yelp doesn't allow 0 stars. This place definitely was a ZERO.
pos	This is one of  best libraries I have ever been to.  I live very close by and it is very easy to stop by to pick something up or drop something off.  This is always a must visit before road trips to California to pick up books for the adults and kids as well as DVD 's for the road trip.  We visit this location at least once a week and the kids love it.
neg	After looking for a car wash & vacuum in the area I selectioned Francis & Sons. I checkeed thier priced on thier website but when I got thier the price they wanted to charge was much more they kept trying to sell an upholstery cleaning and then said I don't take care of my care so there would be an additional $20 to clean the black plastic exterior pieces. I only wanted a qhick exterior  clean and vacuum. They refused to honor thier website pricing and insisted that what I read on thier website was not on there. Needless to say I didn't get my car washed there. I would highly recommend AVOIDING these crooks.
pos	Loved the burgers and the onion rings were fabulous!  This place is a must visi if you are in the Phoenix area anytime soon!
neg	This has to be the worst restaurant in terms of hygiene. Two of my friends had food -poisoning after having dinner here. The food is just unhealthy with tons of oil floating on the top of curries and I am not sure if any health/hygiene code is followed here.  The service is poor and the information on its website is incorrect the owner does not allow dine-in after 9 or 10 even though it says that the restaurant is open till 11.   One night I saw the owner cleaning the place without gloves and she was nice enough to give us a to-go parcel without cleaning her hands (great example to the servers!). I had a peek inside the kitchen when the door was ajar and it definitely looked dirty.  I have been a lot of hole-in-the-wall places around this restaurant including Haji Baba the Vietnamese place and others but neither any of my friends nor I have fallen sick coz of the food. If you need a spicy-food fix i strongly recommend you do not try this place lest you want a visit to the doctor the very next day.
pos	Our company held our fourth annual user conference here and compared to our previous venues this one was a smash hit in terms of facilities.  It compares particularly favorably with the doudy sour old St. Francis in San Francisco a venue I hope we never book again.  The standout quality of this place is the hustle and quality of the service.  Our opening night reception included an array of food service stations with different themes including a noodle bar that was particuarly well done.  The food was all delicious but what really distinguished this event was the personable attentive extra-mile oriented staff.  They were reading the nametags of our 200 guests and calling people by name whenever possible and chatting us up in line to make sure we were all happy.  The event coordinators were all over the venue throughout the ensuing two days.  Where at the St. Francis we struggled with temperature and electrical problems and grumpy uncooperative disinterested staff here at the Fairmont the very few glitches drew aggressive responses by people who cared about our event.
neg	Terrible service--they replaced my phone screen and it broke within 2 wks. Phone was not dropped or mishandled just cracked and \"owner\" would not honor their warranty. They only accept cash--that should be a red flag if you are considering a business like this!
pos	Nooooooooo!  Curse the the gods of all that is delicious for Huauchinango is now CLOSED.  Replaced by some generic grill that offered us some nachos and quesadillas thanks for that.  So not only did you replace a great eatery but you also had to throw in a little bit of extra salt in the wound.  So I don't think I'll be giving my business to the devil grill anytime soon.  Huauchinango you shall now only be a distant whiff of habanero al pastor memory. You shall be missed.
neg	Have been an Ulta customer for a long time but had never tried the salon until recently.  Was a HORRIBLE experience.  My stylist Delia ran 45 minutes late to start me and on several occasions during the hair cut stopped and kept looking around.  She made various odd faces as if to say my hair was a mess.  She not only didn't listen to what I wanted but shot down the only thing I did ask for.  She said I wouldn't look good.  At the end of the painful ordeal she then charged me for a conditioning service I didn't ask for.  At that point she directed me to the line at the front of the store after which I waited in they then sent me back to the salon to make the price correction.  (happened twice then I asked for a manager)  Was very unprofessional all around and would NEVER go back!!!
pos	This is my favorite hotel of all time so far at least of the Kimpton ilk. I experienced nearly impeccable service and a super comfy bed organic and local products a lovely shower and general happy relaxation. I love that the gym and pools are open 24 hours a day. The decor half Asian deco and half Southwestern works works works.
neg	Sadly I have to join the crowd on this one. I was hoping that Kitchen 56 would make my memories of Vatra go away but instead just reminded me all over again. Food was WAY overpriced and just OK. Kudos to Eddie the Server who brought with him the only charm available the second time we tried K56; I'd give him 4 stars if the review were based solely on his service & personality. I will say the interior is much better than the previous incarnation but the spots (lights) at the counter-height 4 top shone in my eyes and made me feel like it was last call...and I don't drink.
pos	Hands down my favorite coffee shop in town. They used to be located inside the Conspire art collective but have now moved into the old Hood Rides digs up the block and it's awesome.  Plenty of seating room at the bar and also a really cool little room next door  where you can pull up a seat and hang out. From what I understand there will be seating outside too.  Most importantly however is the coffee. They use a special mix roasted specially by Cartel. I'll be the first to admit I'm no coffee connoisseur but I do know this every drink I've had no matter who's behind the bar has been perfect. Not burnt not too sweet and not a hint of pretentiousness.  Sooooo why go to S-word Bucks when you can get a better cup of coffee up the street. Oh and for those of us who burn the midnight oil on more than a few occasions they're open until 12am EVERY night.
neg	Can I tell you how much I despised Fate with all its pretentious snooty bullshit? I should have known the second I realized that Bliss/reBar was in the same building that it was probably tainted from all the leftover evil.  And so it is. We showed up and the restaurant was practically empty. There is no hostess or even a hint of one. We stood there for many minutes on end before even being acknowledged by one of the many servers who were rushing around (perhaps serving to invisible people? The place was dead.). We were told there was a 15 minute wait or we could eat on the patio. Um it's 40 degrees...  AND THE PLACE WAS DEAD. I guess we'll wait. We go back outside because there is zero point zero extra room to stand. The server comes back out and says they have two large parties coming in an hour but we can sit inside now if we can be done in 45 minutes. That's sure inviting isn't it.  So we hustle on inside and make some hasty selections. $9 faux comfort food shit like gourmet mac and cheese just offends me so I go with the veggie sandwich. That sounds innocuous enough right? The food came out straightaway - too fast for a burger to be cooked medium well like my companion ordered. Sure as shit she cut into it and it was bleeding and mooing all over the place. My \"veggie\" sandwich arrives and it looks like a Filet-o-Fish from hell some huge block of something unidentifiable due to extreme deep-frying. I couldn't help it - I asked the server what the hell it was.   Eggplant.  Ohhhhkay then.   It was like trying to eat a deep fried brick between two pillows. Impossible. The pretzel bread while yummy is totally unyielding. Only Jenna Jameson can fit that thing into her mouth. My companion was suffering a similar fate with her bleeding burger. There was mayonnaise and shredded cabbage and boiling hot eggplant juice going everywhere and it was goddamn ridiculous. Neither of us got through even a half of our sandwiches. I wolfed down the side salad just to get something remotely healthy in there after the onslaught of grease although I almost choked on the buckets of sugar syrup they call salad dressing.  So while we are attempting to recover from this mess the server goes MIA. You'd think if they were trying to hustle us out of there we'd get a damn check. Nope. No. Nada. Had to chase someone down and ask for it. When it finally came there wasn't even an itemized receipt so even though the total seemed a little low I couldn't check it out. I was so over the whole experience at the point I didn't even care. I left a shitty tip and we escaped to the bar next door where the cute bartenders gave us some free drinks and we sucked down innumerable $3 vodka specials for the next four hours.   Just UGH in every way.
pos	Tacos tacos tacos......how can something so simple be this great? Having seen this place being featured on DDD we had to try it out and it was worth every penny! I have a thing for always trying the \"odd\" menu items so I've tried the tongue tacos and cabeza (head/cheek) burrito and to me there is nothing better on the menu! This place is rather small which makes it perfect if you're there with some friends or a special someone! My friend loves the shrimp ceviche though I havent tried it myself. Go to this place for some great authentic local and quite tasty food.......probably some of the best the east alley has to offer!
neg	Nice selection of stuff but they have so little help available you will wait for darn near forever to get fabric cut THEN wait in line forever to pay.  For such a giant store it appears there are 3 employees.  That's it.  I miss Hancock Fabrics THEY knew how to treat customers.
pos	This past weekend I went to The Vig Uptown twice because it was that  good. This is a perfect place to hangout with friends and get a bite to eat with a really great drink menu. What I love most about this place is that it is very modern and the people are pretty chill. The cherry on top is the games they have to offer Bocce and Bags!  Drinks 1. Moscow Mule is a perfect nice refreshing drink to order made with Vodka/Ginger beer and fresh lime juice.  2. If you bring in your own \"pimp cup\" any size They will fill it up with the mixed drink called Pimms Cup.  Food 1. VigAzz burger is my favorite food item to order because the pretzel bread is amazing. 2. Thai spicy Vings here are probably one of my favorite wings that i've ever had so I highly recommend getting them.
neg	Goddess got it right.  This place is pretty and it looks so promising.  Big disappointment.   There was nothing for vegetarians.  The food was mediocre at best.  I'd choose Pho Nhat over this pretty restaurant any day.  Don't judge a book by its cover.  No good.
pos	Hands-down my favorite pizza place in the East Valley.  I have been going to Sourdough pizza for close to 15 years and it is consistently delicious.  I grew up in Mesa now live in Phoenix but I make it a point to visit Sourdough Pizza when I am in the Mesa area.  The decor definitely leaves something to be desired as they are in a stucco strip mall and their interior probably has not been updated  all that much in the 15 years I've been there.  But I could care less when the food and prices are this good.
neg	This is a sad excuse for a gay resort.  Sort of like a worn out version of Palm Springs.  We found the Zen Yard up on Maryland Avenue a much more agreeable experience in a better neighborhood as well.  Zen Yard is a far better value with full breakfasts included and warm helpful hosts as well not to mention particularly reasonable off-season rates and hosts who are actually there for their guests.
pos	I'm not a fan of ice cream I just don't find it appealing and it's too high in calories/saturated fat. However I do love frozen yogurt and ironically it's much less fattening yet more satisfying. At 25 calories an ounce Golden Spoon's is the best around. There have a large array of flavors to choose from and they rotate flavors each month they also have seasonal flavors such as pumpkin pie and egg nog. You also can get more than one flavor combined. They also have a wide variety of toppings to choose from from gummy bears to low-fat brownies.  Even though their yogurt is non-fat and low calorie adding toppings can quickly add a lot more calories I suggest going with chocolate or rainbow sprinkles (adds less than 50 calories) or if you like fruit go with that.
neg	If you have to be some place on time don't use them.  I called at 2pm for a 4:15 taxi to arrive.  At 4:25 they were calling me saying he was right around the corner and gave me his location.  Estrella called a couple more times to \"verify my address\".  At 4:35 I called them and cancelled the cab and got a ride from my neighbor.  As we pulled out of my neighborhood we PASSED the cab. He had taken a street that he thought was going to be a through street and got himself lost. This is a TAXI service they should know how to get around the valley!!  Don't these people use GPS or MAPS at least?!?!?!?  End of story I was still late for my class that I paid 250.00 bucks for. I was not allowed in and the money is non refundable.  So thanks Estrella wasting my time and costing me money.  WORST TAXI SERVICE EVER.
pos	Phenom.  The food is always fresh and well seasoned. A good selection of Tequila.  Every meal that I've had has been just fantastic. The carnitas and the fish taco's are very well prepared. It's fresh the beans are fresh as is the rice.  It averages about $10 a plate but worth it. This is how really good Mexican should be.  The salsa bar is excellent: you have about 5 different types of salsa from which to choose. All freshly made.  I can't say enough about the flavoring of the meats and fish.  Decor is a somewhat minimalist/modern probably to attract a happy hour crowd. They have TV's for your viewing pleasure.  Service is friendly and quick.  I've only been to the Chandler location but will start going to the one in Scottsdale.  Good food. You won't be disappointed.
neg	Went with three others. My first & last visit.  The menu did not properly describe the item and instead of a bell pepper dish I got a port dish. It was dreadful. The other three I went with were not very happy with their meals either.  The restaurant was extremely noisy. Not pleasant at all & terrible food. Will never go back.  A big disappointment.  They can't even describe their items properly so you never know what you are going to end up with. They called it a pepper dish and it was a pork dish. The sauce apparently contained pulverized peppers. Are they stupid?  I should have trusted my instincts & not the commercial.  It's a third world country. They can barely afford to feed themselves. They have no history of cuisine.  I wouldn't waste my time and money on this place again.
pos	Bring a flashlight. It is so dark inside you can not read the menu. But the waiter was so well versed we just used his recommendations.   We all had filets cooked to perfection and served on a 400 degree hot plate. They recommend the lobster mashed potatoes but did not feel they were worth the price tag.  The wine list is extensive and expensive.  If you are looking for fancy this is the place but we went after a round of golf and they were very accommodating .   Great special occasion dinner but not your everyday steak joint .
neg	Not only was the music the worst I have ever heard the wait staff was as annoying as ever! Like a wanna be swanky place in a strip mall that smells like fish and plays horrible music. Food was so so but over priced for what it was.
pos	These are the best most consistent donuts in the valley.  I was always a fan of the Chandler location so I tried this location as soon as it opened.  I was pleased that the donuts were as fresh and as varied as the other location.  I don't care if people go to dunkin for the coffee..a donut shop is about the donuts and I haven't yet had any donuts in the valley in the same league as BoSa.
neg	Avoid this einstein's at all cost. I have been laying in bed puking for over 12 hours because I ate at this garbage dump. The reason I know it was them? My girl is laying next to me puking as well. And the only place we both ate together less than 24 hours ago was there.  The incompetent staff that happens to grace this poorly operating business cannot tell the difference between a large drink and a medium and take over 10 minutes to make two identical sandwiches.  After we got home and ate them fast forward 6 hours and we are both puking our brains out.  The most common reason for this to happen is when an employee does not wash their hands after getting feces on them. Then they touch my food and I get sick. Based on the staff that day it does not surprise me one bit.  I would recommend starving over going here. Never again. Now I will go speak to Ralph on the big white telephone some more.
pos	I moved from Philly this past summer and I've searched all over the Valley for a \"GOOD\" Pizza. After eating lots of tasteless and cardboard pizza I found Momma Mia when I moved into Arcadia! I love the hole in the wall vibe! Just like home :) The sauce is great and super tasty! The dough tastes slightly sweet and is fluffy..It's what makes the pizza so great and there is a brickoven!! I love it! My husband and I order the pizza/wing special .The wings are so hot and spicy ( we order the hot but it comes in buffalo and mild) They have an extensive menu of pasta sandwiches and salads. I want to try their Philly Steak next but for the time being I still make mine at home.  Every pizza place likes to say its \"New York Style\" but this place really does a NYC pizza. Well the best nyc pizza you're gonna get in AZ Something about the water.
neg	My co-workers and I refer to this place as \"Pizza n' Ants\".  The staff will be happy to serve you with bare hands right after using the till.  Also as the nickname suggests there has been a noticable insect problem.     As if that could all be overlooked the pizza isn't even good.  If you are in this part of town go to Z Pizza or Slices for great pizza instead!
pos	Very delicious and friendly! They do happy hour every day which is so great! The sushi is always very delicious and the same with their entrees. I love how close this is to my house. We visit this place quite frequently!
neg	No no no...do not go here now I'm not talking about the fact that the place looks crappy or the bathroom is suspect but the fact that the food is nasty. It was completely empty when we were there and that should have been some indication on what to expect but no I am a glutten for punishment. I ordered some tacos and didn't even finish the meal I ended up just tossing the food and still got a tummy ache from what little I did eat. This place is definitely not a good look
pos	Oh YEAH!!! Coming to Scottsdale. I have used RedSeven in Tempe and Mesa and excited to know that they are coming to Scottsdale. I work on the roads throughout the valley and have a lot of customers in Scottsdale that I continue to brag to them about RedSeven's Super Quick Service. Getting the job done quick and right and guaranteed to be the fastest to get you back to work!!!! Oh and they talk to you so you can understand not computer talk. Can't wait for Scottsdale!!!!
neg	I had the misfortune of stopping by this establishment today with two things a skirt and a cloth handbag. I asked the woman at the counter if I could have some very minor stitching done on a cloth purse. She looked it over for about 3 seconds and said 'Oh no I don't see how this could be repaired'. (what I wanted sewn were two little pom poms attached to the cloth strap that were loose and I wanted them to be stitched on there tighter). Not a difficult task. She then told me that she could maybe 'send it out' and have it stitched but it would take a week or more to get it back. WHAT??! I then asked her about  the skirt which I wanted cleaned and/or pressed with the tags attached (because I'm selling it). She said no that the tags would be destroyed in the process.  So I went to another dry cleaners and asked the same things for both the skirt and the bag. I was informed that what I wanted done would be no problem and that I could pick it up the next day.
pos	I've been hearing about these cheesecakes from my husband and his incessant twitter following and I was really excited to try some of the goods at the market this past Saturday.  We finally woke up early enough on a Saturday morning to hit up Matt's and then peruse the market before it got too hot.  We made our way over to the cheesecake table and then debated between 10 or so flavors.  He had key lime and chocolate chip out to sample and I decided to try the key lime.  I was amazed at how natural it tasted.  There was nothing artificial about it it just tasted exactly like it should.  These are very good very simple cheesecakes.  I ultimately went with the peanut butter chocolate chip which is extremely tasty.  There are a bunch of different sizes to choose from all at very fair prices.  YUMMY!
neg	Tried a couple Tammie Coe cupcakes and a mini muffin two weeks ago... Unfortunately for them I also sampled Ollie Cakes... No wonder Ollie Cakes aka Urban Cookie won Cupcake Wars and Tammie Coe sits in high rent selling pretty sugar disguised as a cupcake.  Drive a few miles north get whatever the special cupcake of the day is along with a Brown Velvet and Lemon and save saying you enjoyed Tammie Coe for impressing snooty folk who wouldn't know yummy if it bit them on the butt!  Really the TC cakes were just cakes... No flavor no texture dry... And I can't say how impressed I was that the clerk shoved all my selections into one tiny flat bag meant for cookies or sandwiches!  Apparently presentation and flavor preservation mean nothing... As their products now do at least to me.
pos	The best gyro you will have in Arizona... or maybe anywhere.  Love the grocery selection. Everyone there is really nice. And you can buy a BUCKET of dates for like $6.
neg	Just because this place is called \"Maria Maria\" doesn't mean they sell Mexican food. Their menu actually says \"Mexican inspired cuisine\" which should have been my clue to leave. The food is border line Nasty!    The restaurant is cute and sort of romantic but it's so loud in there that it ruins the \"romantic\" mood. I was excited to see they had live music until they started playing some weird pop music. Why would they do that in a \"Mexican\" restaurant?  I wanted to leave but our waitress was no where to be found 20minutes after we finished our meal.  I don't recommend this place for any meal!    I have only been living in Scottsdale for two months but it seem that Arizona is \"Cougar\" town. The bar was full of them. I'm beyond annoyed with all this ladies acting like they are 21 wherever I go. I'm embarrassed for them. They dress and act young but with that face and hands who are they kidding besides themselves? gee.
pos	I've been going to Jess @ Chace Salon for almost 2 years now and she is nothing short of amazing!!  Cut color highlights....she is my super stylist. :) If you are looking for someone to give you a new look or just revamp a style you're already in love with ask for her.
neg	I work right across the street and a few of us went here for lunch one afternoon. I ordered a salad to go. As soon as I saw the guy grab shredded sandwich lettuce to make my salad I almost told him to stop but I didn't. I regreted it when I started to dig in and realized the lettuce was brown and yellow. Very disappointed. $6+ bucks for nasty lettuce tomatoes and green peppers. I ordered a salad thinking I was getting something like the picture on their website. I won't be returning here. I'll be passing on lunch next time the co-workers opt for this place.
pos	i love this place. very rarely do i get to go out and tie one on. when i do this is were i want to be at some point in the night. where else can i go and request the cramps? i...love...this...place it makes me happy. i suppose i should go on and on about what it's like but i won't. go and experience it for yourself.
neg	What.  The.   Heck. ??    Be prepared for sticker shock!  I walked in through the store and made a hasty straight line back to exit.  And over and across the road to Crate & Barrel  - Ahhhhhh - much better!  Whew!
pos	Hands down a great lil joint! Gotta get the guac staff is awesome way cozy and great food!
neg	Rental car review.  118 degrees.  Standing outside in the heat waiting for a bus.  10 minutes go by and I have seen 3 busses leave with out of service signs.  Another 10 minutes pass and no active duty busses.  Finally a bus!  We have a packed bus and the driver is just standing outside.  5 minutes later he comes back on the bus and we drive 10 miles an hour the whole way to the terminal.  PHX...pay attention.  Business travelers do not appreciate being left in the heat for 20 minutes watching out of service busses pass by.
pos	Maestro Chris Bianco whips up addictive sandwiches at his laboratory on Central Avenue. Ingredients are local and super-fantastic. Check out what today's market sandwich is -- if it's oven-roasted pork buy it immediately. Don't miss the rice pudding.
neg	Every time I've been there they have messed up my order in some way. The first time I ordered a sonic blast w Carmel. They charged me for Carmel but there was none in it plus the bottom of the cup was busted and my ice cream was leaking out. The next I went I ordered a reese sonic blast and a snickers they were both snickers. Very upset I haven't been back and I love that place.
pos	Okay I have found my new favorite \"home office!\"  I don't have an office for my agency yet so coffee shops tend to be where I get most of my work done.  Last week I checked out Echo Coffee for a client meeting and we both really liked it.  Today I returned and spent a few hours working at Echo Coffee on their wi-fi. It was such a nice break from my usual home office at Starbucks.  Walking into Echo Coffee you can instantly tell its a different type of coffee experience.  The environment is very relaxing music is not blasting so customers don't have to scream over each other and they have great big couches in the back.  Of course atmosphere and great coffee needs to be in balance and it definitely was at Echo.  The coffee is really good and love very fair price for the quality you get (my 2 favs are Cappuccino at $2.75 and $3.75 for large Chai Latte).  My chai latte came in a big ceramic mug.  I don't know about you but there is just something special enjoying coffee out of big mugs and not recyclable paper cups.  A surprising first for me is getting actual lunch at a coffee place and was pleasantly surprised to find the food was also really good.  Can you tell I am a fan yet?  I ordered a Curry Chicken sandwich and it was huge and delicious so finished the whole thing.  There was a nice bonus on the plate - Mango Chutney so make sure you get that if you order lunch at Echo.  I would have loved just a bowl of that and bread as its flavor was so good.  I need to find out where they get this from as I want to have it at home. About $12.50 for my huge Chai tea and curry chicken sandwich.
neg	Waste of time. I could not even get in there today because there was a football game. The wanted me to pay $10 just to park. How stupid is that! 2 days before Christmas. I noticed all the prices were the same and somtimes more than any other mall. Goobye and good riddens. I have better things to do with my time and money.
pos	This my favorite Chipotle ever!!! It's so consistent and good! No hormones in the meat makes this \"fast\" food an A+ for me!!! Yum!!!
neg	F724   She didn't even look at me didn't bother asking why I was entering her place of business didn't reply when I spoke and in no way acknowledged that I was even in her presence. Just handed me a ticket and was done with me. If this happened anywhere else I would make an effort to never return tell all my friends how horrible this experience was and write a scathing review about the deplorable customer service of this business. Sadly this was my Saturday morning at the DMV a place I think is modeled after the agonizing depths of Hell. With the same musac score playing...and the same voracious stench in the air..and the same spastic children running around (only in my version of Hell it's politicians campaigning around me).   So I was already running late because I had to complete my emissions test early. Those nice people there not only told me there were only three DMVs open on Saturdays they gave me a map. How precious. I was fortunate enough to be near one of the only DMVs open on Saturday (Seriously? Three DMVs open on Saturday for the entire Valley?) After receiving such a magnificent welcome I knew this was quickly going to be among the most painful experiences of my life. To simplify what was so bad let me make a list of what I feel constitutes acceptable behavior in public:   1) Bathe. The combination of water and soap along with massaging the skin creates an outcome that is most pleasing. Be sure to scrub behind your ears and reference this website about another notorious spot : http://www.craigslist.org/about/best/htf/755891987.html   2) Sit still. Yes I know we're all waiting here for about an hour. But tapping your foot rocking back and forth in your chair or bouncing your leg aren't going to make time go any faster. Trust me I was watching the clock. If you feel anxious get up and walk around.   3) Leash your children. If they cannot sit quietly leave them in the car. It's winter they'll be fine. It's not cute when your little monster is running up and down the aisles with his honey bun squeezing out between his fingers. It's even more not cute when he fake-falls five times in a row right in front of me.   4) Maintain quiet tones and ensure appropriate conversations when taking/making calls. To the lady behind me I'm sorry you're not that experienced in stripping. The first thought that popped into my mind was you had a failed audition for Le Girl. Thanks to your continued conversation I was able to figure out you were a woodworker.   5) Acknowledge the humans around you. Yeah I get it. I'm not that big. In fact if I turn sideways I disappear. But I'm still right in front of you so pay attention quit bumping in to me and hitting my leg. Unless that was flirting in which case you really need to find someone more your level.   Oh the DMV: You have a brilliant recipe for dashing dreams and gutting humanity. And you manage to do it in a painfully lit room that reeks of a combination of my brother's old gym shoes and my dad's dirty underwear. There has to be an award for that but I don't have the motivation to research it.   Oh and F724 was my number upon entering. I spent and hour and 15 minutes looking at that slip of paper. Just so you know that one star is for the website (which should probably get 3-4 stars but anchors like this oft sink the ship).    Le sigh...   Open T-Sa 8:00am - 5:00pm; information only after 4:30pm
pos	This place is amazing. Absolutely LEGIT. Some of the best shawarma and hummus in the US (Zankou Chicken in LA is a close competitor). The pita sandwiches are stuffed with delicious fresh meat traditional pickles and tahini or garlic dressing (depending on preference). Ask for their hot sauce to help spice things up even more. And the Jasmine infused lemonade is crazy sweet but really good.   I love this place and have been a die-hard fan for over 4 years now.
neg	Lazy Q CLOSED in 2010.  New Owners cleaned up the place and its called JESTERS BILLIARDS.  Tons of beer AC smoking patio with pool tables.  Re-did tables and got new cues.  Its rockin now.
pos	Stop everything you're doing and go get one of their brownies warmed up with an ice cold glass of milk. I'll never be the same.
neg	So I had this important event to attend in California and I've already spent a lot of money preparing for my trip. Earlier in the month I had received a coupon for $40 off any service at Epic salon. Wow that is a lot of savings and I could sure use to save some money. Epic uses  Goldwell products which is my product of choice. I just needed a tint touch-up (about 1\") so I went to this salon... I had already had an awesome experience at another salon in town but I couldn't pass up the savings by using the $40 coupon)  I was second-guessing the idea of trying a new salon since I had already found one I absolutly loved. .Again though the coupon lured me in. Anyway I walked away with the worst experience ever. Not only was my color wrong ( I am a golden blonde and she colored my 1' outgrowth to a 3\" ash) when I went back in to explain what was so wrong with it (5min later) the front desk lady was rude and cut me off as I was speaking to her. Not the best way to handle a pissed of lady expecially about her hair! I gave them a chance to fix it and the only thing they did was put a gold glaze on my hair which did not help at all.  The style sucked too. I just left. I did not have time to see if they could fix it again. I will not be going back to this place for any services. Noy only because the hair experience was bad but because the front desk gal made a bad impession of the place even worse with her nastiness. UGH! I will give this place 1 star only because on the coupon was also a savings of 30\% off products.
pos	Suffered a senior moment today! Did the yelp check and thought this sounds good...the drive was very dejavu and then I discovered why....see previous review! lol .....but to update....the volcano appetizer sedona roll and Mochi Icecream (which I am becoming addicted to) were all wonderful. Our waitress was also fantastic bringing plenty of their delicious iced tea and keeping the ginger bowl full....a necessity for me. The place was full tonight and I can see why. Question is will I remember?
neg	One of the WORST experiences of my life.  My friends and I decided to go and check this place out as the local radio kept talking about it.  So the day we decide to go the guy from the Colbert report was there mocking the restaurant also.  We go in and we thought \"hey wow this is kinda cool\" as they talked about monster proportions of burgers and fries fried in lard.  However once the food arrived we sat down and although the wait staff was scantily clad all of them had \"cottage cheese\" legs and thighs.  We sat down and my friend decides to take their super burger challenge she said if he finished his 2 lbs burger his meal would be on the house.  He kills it and when we ask why his burger wasn't free we could no longer find out waitress and the owner says to us \"you either pay or i come over the counter\" he threatened us with violence which is stupid as all we were doing was asking what about what the waitress had told us.  We will never ever go there again.  Being Asian he also spewed racial slurs at us calling us to go back to where we came from.  ALL of us were born and raised in Arizona so I don't know where we would go.  Anyways don't go here.    Also all of the patrons ALL of them were middle aged men who instead of paying attention to their wives and kids were hiding away at a nasty restaurant who's burgers aren't even really grilled.  the frozen patties from costco are placed on a machine that rolls the burgers through so you can't even want a medium burger they are all torched.  The fries although fried in lard are crap.  All in all if you're a lonely loser this is the place for you.  If you're a classy kinda guy that wants REAL food go to any other generic burger place and you will be more satisfied.
pos	great 3D Imax theatersee the Transformers...very spectacular
neg	I wish I could give this location a big fat ZERO.  But you can't.  But I can let everyone know how horrible it is.  For starters their automatic doors do not even work.  I just find that appalling.  How can your doors not work on your store?  How are people supposed to get in there to shop.  The manager of this location is nothing more than a jerk.  I asked for help and all I received was attitude.  For a struggling supermarket that filed for bankruptcy I would think service would be one thing you could promote at no cost.  But not here.  I don't think it will be long before this location closes.  RIP!
pos	This is my favorite haunt. Whether it be St. Patricks Day before a sundevil game or just a place to meet some friends for a quick drink. Gavin and the rest of the peeps are great. The food is the good whether out on the patio eating bar food or inside the dining room indulging in dinner.   This place will always be the primary place to grab a Guinness for me.
neg	YUUKK!!!  That pretty much describes this place.  We went there on Sunday afternoon for lunch.  Only 1 person in line in front of us.  I ordered the 2 meat combo rib tips and hot links...sides of mac & cheese and potato salad.     ...it took about 40 mins to get my food.  But I told myself if it was good...then it's worth the wait.  But by God it wasn't good at all.  The mac & cheese had no flavor at all...i mean none.  The potato salad was very flavorless as well.  The rib tips would have been good if they weren't covered in 5 gallons of bbq sauce nasty bbq sauce at that.  Their sauce is like a sweet and sour sauce...was not good at all.  The hot links were mixed in with the rib tips and covered in the same sauce.  So couldn't tell if they were any good cause there was so much of that damn sauce.  The funny part was that the couple that ordered right after me got their food and took it right back to the counter and straight out said that the food was just disgusting.  I wish I would have done the same instead of spending $15+ on nasty bbq.  In short.  I will not be going back here.
pos	I had Thai coffee and thai fresh rolls. It was good. The vegetables were fresh and delicious. Plans to visit again.
neg	I'll start with the positive.  They have some friendly members of staff.  That's it.  You might catch a staff infection here so watch out.  It's like a shack that somehow got a bar licence.  I have a friend who drags me here on occasion as it's his favourite dive.  It's one wrong glance away from a fight every time.  If you like the danger and excitement of drinking a beer in a building that may collapse on you go for it.  If not avoid the dregs of society and go somewhere else.
pos	Delish & authentic! The serving was generous (meat combo fed 2). The injera was good (not too thick/doughy). Spicy and yummy. I would like to return and experience their coffee ceremony.
neg	Like watching a train wreck in slow motion will definitely be going somewhere else for bagels from now on disappointing have been going there for years.  The eight day old cream cheese was a nice touch (yuck!)
pos	Amazing clothing and fantastic deals! As a photographer this is my first stop for designing shoots when I need amazing wardrobe items. The owners are really nice and friendly and very helpful.
neg	Absolutely disgusting.  I had enchiladas and a taco just to give them a chance.  This was the worst mexican food I've ever had.  Waaaaaay too much government tasting cheese on the food and hardly any meat.  I do have really high standards because I grew up on Tex-Mex but this was just pathetic......
pos	This will be a simple post...I love indian food and this is HANDS DOWN the very best in Az. The Chicken makhani is so buttery so savory...the Chicken tikka masala the best I ever had. Service is always good the food comes out fast. It's not super cheap since you have to pretty much order everything ala cart but it is worth it. If you go on Friday or Saturday there is also belly dancers. When in rome!
neg	We use to visit this Pub 10 years ago because they had a nice English waitress and excellent fish and chips for the price.  However we went back a few weeks ago and boy were we disappointed.  The price of the fish and chip dinner went up and they cut the portion in half.  No one assisted us in putting two tables together we had to do it ourselves.  Two guests wanted a good English hot tea and they didn't brew it in advance it was just thrown into a small metal tea pot and we had to ask for cream and sugar.  So we've decided there are newer and better places to eat fish and chips especially up in north Phoenix.
pos	The BEST of the BEST!  I agree with Daren C.  Killer Burgers Steaks Prime Rib and of course ribs.  Food melts in your mouth.  Make this your next restaurant stop.  You will not be disappointed.
neg	My rating is based on the fact that as a vegetarian they charge $8 for a small mediocre bean burrito.  Maybe if this bean burrito were exceptionally good or large in size but it was neither.  I'm not saying that if your idea of Mexican food is Chipolte you will not find what you are looking for and be happy here. But if what you offer your vegetarian customers is deleting the meat and not adding anything else and charging full price I can get MUCH BETTER elsewhere and pay way less.    GRINGOS:  Take off the Chipolte blindfolds!  Go to a real Mexican restaurant and see what real food is supposed to taste like!
pos	One of my new favorite lounges to go to with the girls.   1. I am a HUGE champagne fan 2. You can smoke on the patio 3. the drinks are great and 4. I LOVED the decor and atmosphere.  My friend and I were at Salt next door for a friends birthday party on a Friday night and decided to sneak next door for a drink to check it out.  The staff as a whole were awesome everyone was very polite and sweet.  It has that chic feel with all the servers wearing cute corsets and dresses.  The DJ was great as well fun music that kept the energy level up without making it too clubby and easy to still cary a conversation. Definitely a great new place to sit back and lounge in a place with a fun atmosphere and good service. Yay!
neg	This place has gone so downhill. If I hadnt gotten my chips salsa & water immediately I wouldve walked out. Margaritas are always awesome. But the service and food is straight up AWFUL. Microwaved enchiladas no rice rude cold unfriendly uninviting service...If you're looking for a fabulous neighborhood mexican restaurant try Las Glorias Grill. The location isnt as great but the food service and drinks blows this place outta the water. After years of going to aunt chiladas Im NEVER going back again. They dont deserve your money either....
pos	After reading the great reviews and getting plenty of recommendations to try Fez I had the awesome opportunity to test it out last night at my first Yelp event and I am in love!  From the bright decor to the delicious food to the amazing service (I mean everyone who works there actually looks like they enjoy their job and are having a good time!) this place is 5 star.    I love the cozy lounge feel and could easily see myself enjoying several hours of delicious cocktails and conversation with friends.  This would be a great spot for dinner drinks or even an event (another Yelp event please!).  Highlights: Tasty drink menu Fabulous wicker tables and trendy IKEAish style Great part of town Sexy servers...dang  Impress someone: Take them to FEZ!
neg	I'm never shopping here I don't wanna shop somewhere where associates think if u can afford it in just goona purchase the bag online then looked at if I could afford it
pos	Yes it is small yes it takes time to get your order but the quality of the food serve is excelent !!! Celina is the name of the owner (not Selena) of this fabulus resturant.  She takes your order runs to the kitchen and then she serves your order too. I wouldn't say that this is a one person resturant because she has help in the kitchen.   Very few Mexican resturants in Phoenix serve food as good as this one. The Menu is limited but whatever you order you will not be disappointed.
neg	Your reviews are hilarious!!   (shoot--who was this referring to??)  I try to avoid WM.  I'm always warned about the possibility of TB or now pig flu.  I think the hub just doesn't want to go shopping--not that I LIKE shopping.  I know someone who worked WM in WA and she says the conditions are just horrible for employees.  I've spoken to at least one cashier that is actually FRIENDLY and LOVES his job benefits and bonuses.  He's a minority I guess bc as you all said YOU CAN'T FIND ANYTHING and CAN'T GET HELP without attitude usually.    I'm standing there staring at 2 mgrs and they just ignore me for a few minutes?  I didn't want to interrupt the conversation so I waited.  FINALLY one asks if I need help???  NAAAAAH I was just admiring your huge body and wondered how long it might take me to look that way.  FOOLS!    On my last visit a customer said \"excuse me\" to the 3 employees behind me in the aisle.  I glanced at her and she sighed rolled her eyes and shook her head as they all ignored her.  I chuckled and acknowledged her frustration.  Then one employee pipes up with \"OH I'm sorry ma'am can we help you?\"  She asks to find an item the customer thanks them they say \"You're welcome\" the customer leaves and they sarcastically continue to each other: \"THAT'S WHAT WE'RE HERE FOR.  NO THAT'S NOT WHY WE'RE HERE.  We're not here to find stuff for stupid people we have better things to do.\"    That's why when I walk by an employee working if they lay eyes on me they immediately look away and pretend to be engrossed in their job to avoid stopping to help.  WT?  What's wrong w/this management???    I agree you can find some deals and save some money but the attitude is over the top.  There are a FEW employees that actually smile and appear friendly at least when I see them and I can point them out.  If not for the more often than not occurences as mentioned above I stay OUT of WM as much as possible which is a lot.  I've drastically reduced my trips there but more importantly I've cut out a huge chunk of purchasing from WM.
pos	Can't go wrong with an iced gingerbread latte hot waffle with Nutella spread and free wi-fi - especially shared with my beautiful wife. :)
neg	This was the second time I placed an order over the phone that was delayed over an hour. I was told over the phone that it was going to be only 15-20 min for me to pick it up. I showed up 30 min later and my order was still delayed. I ended waiting for another half of hour to receive my order. The pick up service was the worse I have ever experienced.
pos	Yup I'm reviewing a gas station. I like the Quiktrip chain in general and this station in particular.  I find Quiktrips to generally be the cheapest gas in town. Sure the Arco sign down the street might say it's 2 cents/gallon cheaper but then you get whacked with the ATM surcharge not to mention there's all those bums loitering in the adjacent bus stop.  With Quiktrip the place is well lit there's always a trash can and window squeegee at every pump the convenience store is better than most and unlike most other gas stations they don't charge you for the air compressor. Oh and the person at the register will actually greet you when you step inside the door while managing to sound sincere about it. Is that the coolest thing for a convenience store or what?   Bonus: for those of you who enjoy shopping at the Hot Chick Safeway down the street this is the Hot Chick Gas Station.
neg	Great in its day now leaves a lot to be desired.  Deserves credit as a Phoenix landmark Chinese restaurant.    This restaurant has been here for 38 years.  I've been going here off and on for 35 years.  I go here more for sentimental reasons and not so much for the food.    The interior still retains some of the original decoration style from the original restaurant established nearly 40 years ago.  The rest of the decorations have been torn out.  I believe the decor is modeled after the Forbidden Palace in Beijing - see the vault-of-the-heavens style crenelations in the ceiling.    I have this restaurant - in its former self - to thank for this:  Back in its day this restaurant was really great and the entire atmosphere lent to an ambiance that actually inspired me to study Chinese and then later go live over there for some years.   Sadly the food here is not all that good.  The fryer oil they use here is pretty old.  The fried rice arrives looking almost black (from the fryer oil?  too much soy sauce?) instead of a rich golden brown and tastes overcooked somehow.  The eggrolls are just OK.  Definitely not fresh.  A lot of the menu items from the original owners are no longer on the menu; for example the special \"Chinese cakes\" served on a plate topped with a delicious gravy-like brown sauce and shallots - probably some form of Cantonese food.  All of this is gone and replaced by very plain fare and not very good at that.    If you like salty greasy plain-tasting yet somehow edible Chinese food not far from the $1-per-scoop variety then go here.  Golden Phoenix's heyday as a great restaurant is long-gone.  Let us bow our heads in sadness to a place that once was very good - now passed on...
pos	Tried going there for my 1st visit and they were closed during hours they were supposed to be open.  Have tried calling them a few times during normal business hours and did not get anyone to pickup.  They may be closed for good.  Not sure.
neg	I don't know what's up with Eddie??? I always found him to be pleasant and really taking care of the customers. However on the 17th of November we had a birthday party of 19 people and they gave us one waitress. We sat down at 7:00 pm and our main course came at 9:15. No real big deal but one person can't handle a table of 19 and we were having fun. So one of the guest's had ordered the $12.00 burger along with a salad and told the waitress no Mayo because he can't stand it at all. The burger comes out and it has Mayo on it and he tells the waitress. She was not at fault and had written it down clearly. He asked for a new one and she comes back and say's Eddie cooked the hamburger and refused to cook a new one but would make him a new bun. He didn't want that because he hates Mayo that much so there was no problem taking it off the tab but Eddie would not make a new one. LOL. What's up Eddie??? I don't understand at all you take it off the bill because you screwed up but refuse to make another burger that you would have been paid for.  Then you end up looking like a fool in front of the other eighteen people. My daughter has even taken one of your classes and said what a great guy you are. Really Really bad PR that night and the next birthday party wont be at Eddie's House. Great time that night but the ending leaves a very bad taste in 19 people's mouth.
pos	Piestewa and Camelback Peaks are the two boobs of Phoenix. They're real and they're spectacular.   Of course being all-natural one is just a slight bit larger than the other but this is barely noticeable. Camelback is barely 100 feet higher than Piestewa whose nipple... er... summit is at 2608 feet. Climb either one and you can enjoy great views of the other at various vantage points not to mention views of the city.   Although Camelback strikes me as a funner climb I give Piestewa 5 stars because for what it lacks in the intangible fun factor it makes up with being just a tad less insanely crowded. Piestewa Peak Park also has a number of really cool looking trails that don't go up to the summit which look to me to be worth exploring some day.  Speaking of female body parts the former name for this peak was \"Squaw\" Peak. This has inspired one of the most ridiculous controversies in modern times in our state. Native Americans are offended by the term \"Squaw\" and regardless of the linguistic origins of the word it is basically the equivalent of terms such as \"Negress\" or \"Jewess\". In the 1990s the State of Arizona proposed ending the controversy by renaming the peak after our greatest political leader ever and the father of American conservatism Barry Goldwater. The whining dipshits who apparently constitute our voting population rejected the idea. They'd rather continue using a stupid name that has no historical or sentimental value whatsoever just to spite Native Americans rather than honoring one of their finest citizens.  And so in this decade Democratic Governor Janet Napolitano put an abrupt end to the whole issue. She gave the sqaw-apologists the finger and ordered the renaming of the peak to Piestewa after Lori Piestewa the first US woman soldier to be killed in the 2003 Iraq war and a member of the uniquely-Arizonan Hopi Nation. A fitting end to the debate.  NOTE: Even more fitting the original name of this peak was Squaw Tit Peak and I swear to God I'm not making that up to be funny.
neg	How very disappointing!  Nello's had a delightful menu with an array of salads pizzas and sandwiches. Not Jac's. If the new restaurant wants to be a \"pub\" it should have a wider variety of selections. The menu was sad.  Due to dietary restrictions I asked for a plain garden salad. Lettuce tomatoes and onions. And it wasn't very fresh either. Sad.  Guess we'll be driving up north to Pima Crossing to visit Nello's.
pos	I just love Chipotle. Fresh yummy spicy (if you want it to be). And the restaurant was clean a HUGE plus! My personal fav is the chicken burrito no rice no beans w/ fajita veggies pico cheese sour cream and lettuce. Guacamole and hot sauce on the side. So delicious!!! The person who did our order was so nice! It was my friend's first Chipotle experience! She was impressed by how big the burrito was. I'm glad I only live a few blocks away... because I will be back.
neg	Great donuts but horrible service... Didn't get anything we wanted due to a language barrier between us and the limited English speaking employee. She claimed in broken English to only speak Spanish. She understood ONLY the word \"dozen\" and we got a dozen of what ever she felt like giving us then proceeded to ignore us while using her cell phone! Donut shops are a dime a dozen and we will never again return to Bosa.
pos	I love you Marquee Theatre.   Just last night I saw Dashboard Confessional here and it was packed.  I have seen many shows here and I have not a single complaint about The Marquee. The bartenders are really friendly the bouncers do a great job and the bands they have play here are always phenomenal. Not to mention the sound guys do an awesome job.   I love how big it is in the Marquee because it allows for tons of people to see a great show. One thing that most venues fail at is keeping it cool inside of the venue The Marquee on the other hand does a tremendous job of keeping the temperatures bearable in there.   The only thing I hate (and this has nothing to do with The Marquee itself) is that I am always standing next to belligerently drunk annoying girls who can't seem to keep their mouths shut during a set.... Please don't speak... I am listening to Chris Carrabba's angelic voice thanks.   All in all I think that The Marquee Theatre is my favorite venue of all time.
neg	So far my restaurant experience in Phoenix has been subpar when it comes to service and this one took the cake. Everytime the server came to our table it was just to do one thing and we would be left in the lurch with our mouths silenced in the middle of asking for something. Finally the food came and it was actually quite delicious I ordered the turkey eggs benedict with potatoes and fresh fruit. However once again the food was dropped off with no silverware no condiments and no refills on the coffee. I truly hope the restaurant re-trains the staff or hires a whole new batch because I am afraid food alone can not keep a business afloat.
pos	Their food was GREAT! I had the pancit lumpia and that purple rice! The price was not bad for the amount of food that they gave you!  Even though they had a very long line they were still very fast with service!
neg	Sorry Banana Leaf... I'm usually not picky at all but the Thai Curry Tofu and Vegetable dish I picked up last night was awful.  Really... it was almost not edible.  The packaging was not great so it kind of spilled a bit in the bag - not a good start.  Perhaps the curry is the 'yellow curry' that Jenny R refers to in her review - maybe the chef should taste it before serving it - it was nasty!  Seriously I've had better Asian food from the food court at the mall before!  I will say you did listen to my request to add eggplant to the dish - thank you... but if someone requests eggplant perhaps you should make sure it's cooked fully next time.  I had a bite that was barely cooked - it was crunchy.    So needless to say - I don't think I'll be giving you another shot.  First impressions sometimes last a lifetime.  Sorry Banana Leaf!
pos	FINALMENTE!!!  Andiamo....  FOOD -------- Appetizer: Fritto Misto which is a trio of fried appetizers. For the day ours included a cheese a stuffed olive and whole leaves of broccolini. The cheese wedge was great (I wish I remembered what it was) and have you ever had a deep fried veal-stuffed olive? Very interesting. The flash-fried broccolini took a little getting used to since the leaves kept crumbling as I was trying to eat them but still tasty if subtle.  Main: Orecchiette alla Puttanesca. Man. This is the real deal. Orecchiette is the \"little ear\" pasta and \"alla puttanesca\" means it's made \"whore style\".   And what a beautiful classy yet very vibrant whore she is.  The pasta was cooked just perfectly and even though puttanesca sauce usually goes with a stringier pasta (spaghetti linguini etc.) it worked really well with the orecchiette.   And the sauce. Holy mother this streetwalkin' hussy of a sauce with its 12 ingredients: capers breadcrumbs anchovy sauce garlic olives basil olive oil and uh the other 5. The flavors were a perfect clear-heeled harmony. Nothing overpowered the other. Subtle and humble home food. It really tasted just like something my Italian friends' mothers would cook in their kitchen.  As for the servings when I first got my bowl I was thinking \"oh ok this is a European serving. I'm still going to be starving after this.\" And um nope. Why? Because I slowed down. I savored my meal and took my time with the dish. And by the end was I hungry? Not at all. I really enjoyed this meal. And the serving was just right. Complimentary packs of long breadsticks are also found on each table.   SERVICE ------------- Very friendly efficient and willing to go through the menu in detail and answer any more questions about the restaurant. Dishes were brought out in a timely manner and there was never any rush after the meal was completed to clear the table.   And the mood inside Pastabar was palpable. Everyone looked happy excited and relieved that the restaurant was finally open for business. And I felt the same for them.   SETTING ------------- I would say the space was just the right size. Not a cavernous place in the least. Probably the same size as Sens maybe  even a little smaller. It's tucked away in the very back of the hallway of the building so much so that I completely missed it when I was IN THE HALLWAY the previous afternoon looking for it. But I like it a little hidden off actually.   The colors inside are warm with a modern bistro feel. No windows looking outside but I didn't mind that. There is seating at the bar a few two-tops up front and larger tables in the back. Selections from different Shins albums made up the soundtrack throughout the dinner and while the music sounds like it could be incongruous with a bunch of little ears cooked whore-style it worked.   I definitely don't think this is going to be as \"scene-y\" as Sens. It has a completely different vibe.   EXTRA CRIB NOTES ----------------------------- * the main courses of Pastabar are pasta and ONLY pasta. No veal parm here. And no hoikey sauces like Olive Garden-y alfredo or a jar of sugary Prego. * It's great * Prices for antipasti range from $7-$11-ish and mains $11-ish to $18. I spent around $26 with tax and a nice tip. * it's great * No liquor license (yet). For now sparkling waters lemonades a number of sodas (including root beer & cream soda).  * it's great * complimentary valet awaits the diners if you're averse to parking close by yourself. * it's great * It's open till midnight on weeknights and 2 am on weekends! What more could you ask for? * did I tell you it's great?  ALL IN ALL --------------- An awesome asset to the area and I'm very content. And as much as I loved my whoreish little ears all the other pastas on the menu sounded incredible and I can't wait to try them all.   I'm wishing these guys much success and giving them gratitude to finally being open. A few minor kinks to be worked out (and I wasn't as into the appetizer as I was my entree) so it's not totally perfect but they have started out very strong and it's only Day 2.  And here I was thinking my days of giving out 5 stars were over (ok more like 4.55 and rounding up)...
neg	I would absolutely not recommend living here. I lived at these apartments for a year and wow was the management staff a MESS. When I moved in my mailbox was broken so I couldn't get mail for a week. They didn't give me a pool key they gave me the wrong apartment keys they would mix up all my information and they just weren't very nice. I can't remember how many times they lost my work orders so I'd have to call and call to make sure things got fixed in my apartment! The neighbors were loud--I had to call the police maybe four times because they wouldn't turn down their music and I had to study for school and finals and random people came banging on the door looking for some girl who had obviously p'd them off. The police came to my house in the middle of the night looking for her too. One time they gave my garage to somebody else even though I was still paying for it and when my husband came home in the evening with his pick-up full of expensive equipment we had to wait for the cops to come and figure out whose car it was who was parked in our garage! it was a total nightmare. Shortly before I moved out new staff came in and they seemed somewhat better organized. But---I wouldn't take the chance. For the same price you can definitely find somewhere better to live.
pos	This has by far been my favorite movie theater and favorite movie chain in Arizona.  This location is better than the others I have been to - quieter friendlier staff.  The theaters are clean and usually not packed either.  I love the t-shirt and cup program - and buying tickets at Costco.  I went to AMC last month and spent a lot more money all the way around and did not like the theater either.
neg	I had received an email from a student retention telling me that I still owe money for the time that I had taken classes (two weeks) although these fools canceled my financial aid. I will sue this school if they even attempt to collect money from me and I have withdrawn from the classes on the right time but this rep. told me that the withdrawal period was Jan. 11.
pos	If you've read some of my other reviews you'll see a trend.   Kohl's Department Stores.....Brewers spring training......   Yep I'm a cheesehead. (But if you EVER actually catch me wearing a hunk of fake foam cheese on my head shoot me. Really.)   What can I say? I like Culver's. It reminds me of home. It's total comfort food.   Got one of their Wisconsin Swiss melts. What other fast food joints offer burgers with Swiss on rye? The crinkle cut fries are always hot and fresh. And tasty.   Culver's is known for their frozen custard. What Wisconsinite has not driven past a Culver's looked at their sign checked out the 'flavor of the day' and gone \"Hey that sounds good!!\" and quickly pulled into the parking lot?   If you're from Wisconsin or the Midwest stop in for a Butterburger and some custard....it will bring back lots of good memories.   Like another reviewer noted when he said he felt like he was in Iowa or something.....well.....that's the whole charm behind Culver's. You DO feel like you're in Wisconsin or one of the upper Midwest states.   Granted I'm not the best person to review Culver's....I'm a little biased towards it. But if you want a 'different' kind of fast food experience and you've never been to the upper Midwest it's a heck of a whole lot cheaper than flying there.   Give it a chance....see if you like it.
neg	I'm sorry to be what seems to be the lone one star review.  Either I got there on the worst day in their history or everyone drank the Koolaid or I just have different expectations and taste buds. It seems like a great idea.  It's a build your own burger joint $7.00 gets you a cooked to order burger with one cheese up to 4 toppings and 2 sauces with fries or onion rings-or some other choices.  They also claim that the beef is local hormone free etcetera....  I chose a rare burger with American grilled onions sauteed mushrooms. tomato and lettuce with mayo and mustard on a potato bun.  I added bacon for a dollar.  First let me point out that if you are in a hurry DON'T GO HERE TO EAT.  I waited exactly 39 minutes for my food. This would not be a big deal if: 1.  I had been warned before they ran my credit card--what if I only had 30 minutes for lunch?? 2. They had places to sit but it's tiny and full. 3.  They had magazines a jukebox ANYTHING to entertain you for 39 minutes.  You can't even get your drink early to sip on that.  At the 30 minute mark I'm ready to eat cardboard with a little ketchup on it so maybe they make you wait so everything tastes even better? Anyway before my burger comes up I notice that the lady behind the counter is saying that the orders overwhelmed the kitchen.  I look in the kitchen---they have ONE GUY TRYING TO DO ALL THIS??????   He'd better be getting a share of the profits!!!!!  Now I'm jsut feeling really bad for this guy back there.  I finally get my burger!  YAY!!  I'm SO excited!  All those 4 and 5 star reviews!  I take a bite and....the patty shoots out the other side of the bun like it had been shot out of a cannon. WTH?  I look at the patty.  It's clean as a whistle. I mean there is no mayo or mustard or cheese smeared on the patty.  I turn it over and it slides out of my fingers back into the basket.  The other side is clean too.  The freakin' burger was so greasy it slid all over the place!  Then a greasy glop of what must have  been the mushrooms and onions slid out.  Still not seeing any cheese mayo or mustard anywhere.  Just oil.  Tons and tons of oil.  I open the bun  On one side is a heavily oiled slick of lettuce glued to the bun by (I am guessing) a slice of cheese.  The other side of the bun has some mayo and mustard residue--and more oil.  I'm grossed out but hungry.  I take a bite.  It's not rare  It's well done and oddly tastes very faintly of liver.  BTW remember the bacon I paid a dollar for?  Not there.  I'm really puzzled that instead of cheese. or beef or SOMETHING I just taste that faint livery taste. So I take another bite.There isn't even any salt or pepper or anything on the burger patty.  This is perhaps the worst grade of meat available for human consumption.  I take a third bite because that second bite brought back a memory of when I worked for a meat company here in town.  Now I recognize the flavor.  I'm not saying that what I ate that day at Two Hippies was old dairy cow but that's EXACTLY what it tasted like.  At this point I turn to the fries.  The are shriveled and DARK and taste like they've been fried and then microwaved.  I couldn't get out of there fast enough!  Forget my danged dollar!  just get me in the car!  Exactly one hour and 20 minutes later I had vicious diarrhea  I haven't had that trouble even with eating junk food at the fair!  No.  NO.  A thousand times NO!  Red Robin is my next burger stop.  Period
pos	Let's be honest when you walk into a tanning salon if you have high hopes you'll expect to see a nice person behind the counter who is friendly and can tell you the prices for packages and the max times on the beds.  If you have low expectations you'll expect a bored teenager who hands you a price sheet and stares at you looking bored.  Walking into the Total Tan I had pretty good expectations based on the reviews and even those were blown away.  Dallas was the person who helped me (I think he's one of the owners?) and he was sooooo friendly and knowledgeable I spent more than I was originally planning but I feel good about it actually.  I had looked at the pricing online so I had an idea of what I wanted but he explained things about the beds that I never knew and that none of the other salons I'd been to had ever told me.  He was super personable too even asking for my name just during his explanations of everything before I had committed to buying anything.  He made sure I knew every detail of the beds the differences gave recommendations and was never pushy with any of it.  During our conversation several people came in and he always asked my permission first to take care of them and I don't think he had to ask for their names once a good sign that he pays attention and remembers his customers.  I could go on and on because I was so impressed with his service and also the location itself (super clean trendy nice extras in the rooms like baby wipes and extra towels) but I think you get the point by now.  Just check this place out you'll be happy you did.
neg	Ok so I have to share my morning experience. But first I must start off by saying this: I'm no moron. Honest.   So this morning I stopped for gas. My tank was getting dangerously low and there was no way I'd make it to work. That's okay for I allotted time this morning for re-filling my tank. From my casa I turned East on Indian School vaguely remembering there's a Quick Trip nearby. Perfect. I had stopped there before.   But it wasn't a Quick Trip I saw at the corner of Central and Indian School. Not wanting to risk running out of gas I opted to stop here at this ampm station.   I pulled up to the closest gas tank got out of my car took off my gas cap and reached for the gas nozzle. Only then I discovered there was no pay-at-the-pump option. The short notice on the pump said to select my grade and start filling. \"Wow\" I thought \"It's so odd for a station to trust people - especially in this area - to not drive off without paying.\"   So I followed the instructions but nothing happened. I kept hitting the grade button. It kept beeping back at me. Still nothing. To top it off (no pun intended) the nozzle was wrapped in this huge rubber tube thing that compressed when I applied pressure to the handle. I had never seen anything like it.   Thinking my particular pump was fuct up I pulled my car up to the next one. That's when I saw it - this strange machine like an Amtrack ticket dispenser. I approached with curiously. That's when I realized. You swipe your card at this central machine (or deposit cash if that's your preference) and then go back to your pump. Ah-ha. This is how this station works. So I did just that. I punched in my gas pump number (4) and went back to my car to re-fill the tank. Already annoyed at this point I figured I'd pump enough gas to get me through the next couple of days.   Only it wasn't pumping. The long rubber thingy was hindering my ability to hook the nozzle up to my gas tank. UGH. So that's when I flexed my muscles and applied enough pressure to squeeze out $12 worth of gas. Then I re-hooked the nozzle on its perch and walked back to the strange machine for my receipt - it told me to do so when I swiped my card. Only no receipt came out. I punched the keypad with defiance and walked off.   Stupid ampm station. Since when does any gas station benefit from being different? I'm so used to pay-at-the-pump; you just swipe your card select your grade pump your gas grab your receipt and go. Quick Trip doesn't torment me like this. There is no rubber nozzle thingy in my way. Grr. Screw this. I'm never going back there again.

pos	This place really made a terrible situation as easy as possible.  Our cat was hit by a car or beaten and my husband found her immobile and crying horribly in pain.  We rushed her to the clinic and the doctor saw her right away.  She told us our options but was very upfront about the liklihood that our kitty would pass no matter what we did.  She didn't pressure us one way or another and left the room so that we could talk privately and make our decision.  My husband asked if they could give her some pain meds while we talked about it and they gave her some immediately.  Once we made our difficult decision to put our kitty down she brought the cat into a private room with us so that we could say goodbye.  She left us alone and gave us as much time as we needed.  She also let us be present in the room when they gave her the final shot.  At all times the doctor and the techs were compassionate and very respectful.  I was crying and they were very sensitive to my feelings.  They treated my little kitty so gently even after she had passed.  They even sent a sympathy card to our house a few days later.  I really appreciated how they helped us through this difficult time and I would definitely reccommend them if anyone else is in a similar situation.
neg	Wow. Worst food poisoning of my life. Ate here Saturday night for my birthday. Started to just not feel right about 20 minutes afterward. Sunday I never left the bed except to go be sick. I lost a full FIVE pounds in one day. Stay away from the salmon. I for one will never go back. I'm really sad too because I decided on it from the reviews. Another reviewer said they were disappointed in the recent quality. I should have listened!!
pos	OK yeah everyone LOVES teriyaki we know!  Well don't so quickly dismiss the other absolutely AMAZING dishes served here!  It may look like a little pre-processed Japanese hole in the wall from the outside but they're a die hard home-made mom and pop your mouth full of great food establishment!  I'd highly recommend trying the Katsu bowl! You can hardly find ANY kind of Japanese katsu in AZ yet they have an excellent one that's very traditional but not too expensive! I'd love to explain the mystique of this dish but too many people think that fried egg with onions and leeks topped over a diced pork cutlet that's coated in panko bread crumbs is too strange to be palatable.  Well to them I say you should educate your tongue and expose it to some delicious culture!   There's also Orange chicken... This dish is completely the bee's knees. It easily and without remorse makes Panda Express look like a burnt out oil can that a homeless person decided to cook some chicken in over a pile of burning newspapers.  Their house beef? Spicy garlic brown sauce and beef with mushrooms? Heaven.  Simple and delicious.  And I haven't even mentioned their coup de grace yet.  Their fried rice might seem a little \"heavy\" on the surface as it's lightly fried with some garlic oil but it outclasses all competitors.  Paired with their lightly fried shrimp it's sweet garlic love.  Seriously their fried rice is the Sean Connery of fried rices.  As I've been eating here for far longer than I'd like to admit I'd have to say I might be a little biased.  But for the great unique quality and cheap price I guarantee you're not going to find any better in AZ!
neg	Horrible experience. We had a home emergency which forced us to move out for 15 days. We referred to them by a friend. We explained to them we're Seniors on limited income but assured them they'd be paid in full. We paid the medical and our insurance co verbally told them that once the bill was submitted they would be paid.  But No No NO!!!!  \"Not our policy\"  They were holding our two kids for ransom!!!  Horrible uncaring staff to deal with.
pos	I first heard about gangplank at the Arizona Entrepreneurship Conference last year.  Since then I have been a regular there and the people that co-work or work there are some of the most inspirational ones I know and are passionate about bringing start-up culture to Phoenix area.    The companies that anchor Gangplank are always working overtime to plan events from Gangplank Jr. for kids to learn programming to the Wednesday \"brown bag\" talks that have ranged in topics from how to pitch to angel investor to a local news anchor talking about how they are using Twitter as a resource for news leads.  Gangplank rocks.  Nuff said.  @iamtimhardy
neg	This place is the classic bait and switch joint.  I ordered through the drive-thru and told the person I was ordering that I had a coupon for a \"buy one-get one free\" Chicken Tender Sandwich  The bun was hard and not at all like the picture on the coupon. The two small tenders were extremely rubbery and looked like they had been retrieved from the trash can after they had been tossed for being under a heat lamp too long. The lettuce was the part that most people toss when cleaning and the tomatoes were thin and pale and looked like they had been genetically mutated . . .uhh I mean grown.  This wasn't the first time the server manager did this to me. I should have known better. I used a coupon a while back there for a buy one get one free breakfast burrito and asked that they prepare it to look like the picture that appeared on the coupon. My bad!  When I got down the road and reached into the bag to take a bite the cook had apparently taken an onion and diced it up super fine and threw that in with it.  If you want a decent hamburger or chicken sandwich without attitude and that looks as advertised or better go to smash burger. As for this place never never  again.  The only good Carl's Jr. I have found in the valley so far is off the Superstition (Hwy 60) and Tomahawk.  From the Manager down they strive to live up to their advertising.
pos	I'm President of the Local scooter club so I know and deal with most of the dealers Valley Wide. Tylor the GM and team run a good shop. Very friendly. Don't get me wrong they are there to make money but they are not push. You are free to hang out and ask lots of questions. Good assortment of accessories and they can pretty much get anything.  They know bikes and parts inside an out. Service on my Piaggion BV500 has been fast and fantastic. I did not say cheap but fair.  Actually they had a Buy 1 tire get the 2nd for 1cent event this week. In the past they had a 1/2 price on all their helmets. Got a Scorpion $220 helmet for about $110. Just ask what and when they are having specials.  I don't buy the review below about bait and switch pretty serious accusation. However GoAZ and Gina over there are good people as well.
neg	I have heard so many good reviews for this place so who wouldn't try it? I should have taken the hints before I got my meal that this wasn't a good choice.  Hint 1: Location - It's right next to a smoke shop and a gas station across the street from a mobile park.  Hint 2: Food test - It was nice that I got to sample the food even if the first sample wasn't up to par the guy wouldn't leave me alone about sampling.  Hint 3: Decor - I know this should never have anything to do with the food but it felt like I was eating at a cousins house on the bad side of town wobbly chairs wobbly table.  I ordered the teriyaki chicken (didn't think it would be bad I mean who can mess up teriyaki?) With chicken fried rice (once again how on earth can you mess up fried rice?)   The chicken tasted like it was frozen and thawed out all day. Such a horrible taste. The fried rice tasted like it too was thawed out kind of had a gross tangy after taste. There also wasn't any spices or egg in the fried rice just a bunch of green onionwhich technically isn't a fried rice. This meal can be related to something you get in the frozen section at a grocery store.  They also give you a snickerdoodle cookie that looked like it could be the best thing on the menu until I noticed it wasn't cooked all the way through.  But the icing on the cake was the gross pube like grey hair I found floating in my teriyaki sauce.   So the expensive $8 meal was so not worth it and I 'm sure when Diners Drive Ins and Dives visited the food was great but today it was the grossest thing I've ever had.
pos	Yep -- still my favorite hole-in-the-wall eatery awesomeness. The brisket sandwich with cheddar and slaw and dippin' sauce was to die for. I ate at the bar and just enjoyed my visit.  Can't wait til I can walk here!
neg	Not good. And it's not been for a couple of years. There are advantages: good location rarely busy good for larger groups. But last few times we've been there have experienced average food and lousy service.  When joining my already seated group on Saturday (3/28) the high-school hostess wagged her finger in my face like an East German border guard the waffle house waitress poked me in the shoulder to get my attention and the wife's chicken dish had to be sent back as there were only 2 measly pieces of chicken in it.  Only 2 beers on tap. Garbage.
pos	Having lived in Chicago for most of my life I was more than nervous of what an Arizona pizza experience would be like. For the most part my assumptions were correct - but Grimaldi's is great! We get the margarita pizza and it's amazing. I'm normally a deep dish pizza person but Grimaldi's is slowly winning me over for thin crust. Also this place has amazing cheesecake - the best I've ever had in a restaurant.
neg	Will never eat here again. Sandwich was meteocre and overpriced. On top Of that I was charged more than I was told the total was. Horrible first time experience!
pos	Everyone here is very helpful and friendly.  No matter who I come in contact with I can tell they love animals and care about me and my pet.  The vet calls me himself to discuss my cat's test results.  They also made sure to give me a lot of information regarding the medications they are putting her on.  I feel that my family gets good care from this vet.  We ended up moving about 15 minutes away but still make the trip to see this vet.
neg	Went last week and ordered a dozen variety. I didn't care for any of them very dry the frosting wasn't very goodeven my 9 yr old daughter spit her cupcake out!
pos	No matter where you go in the World if you are wearing an in and out shirt or hat some big guy usually yells out \"In and Out Man I love that place\" I think that says it all.
neg	We've been going here for 25 years and I had my first BAD meal recently. A rotten chicken tamale the corn meal might have had rancid fat in it or the chicken was rotten either way it was stinky. The wait staff didn't seem outraged and shrugged it off as though this has happened before.  I may go back here in another year but Rosita's Place is off limits for me now.
pos	Video Paradise is great.  For those who aren't financially comfortable enough for the monthly payment to maintain a NetFlix account or when you don't feel like buying something from Amazon.com Video Paradise is a wonderful substitute if you want to get something that you know won't be at Blockbuster or Hollywood Video.  The selection is staggering.  I remember the first time I stepped in I was amazed.  The only movie I really wanted to see and they didn't have was The Helstrom Chronicle but that's okay.  I'm not going to ding this place because they didn't have it.  \"You didn't have The Helstrom Chronicle?  Lame!\"  I mean come on.  No one else has it.    This place had it all from little indie films to gross-out horror films I had long forgotten from my disturbing adolescence (Cannibal Holocaust Faces of Death etc.).  They even had the worst movie I'd ever seen in my life:  Hard Rock Zombies.  The décor is that of sheer unbridled love for cinema.  You can easily spend hours and hours browsing through their selection.
neg	Love the idea - vegan Mexican. Have tried to eat there twice. Both times checked their FB page for hours both times they were closed. Called their phone number no one answered. No sign no explanation on FB. Pathetic.
pos	Weekend plans prevented me from kicking off AZ Restaurant Week on Saturday. So on Monday Venyse and I headed to White Chocolate Grill where we both had our cherries popped.  We started out with the spinach artichoke dip. The blends of cheeses made this perhaps the single most spectacular dip I've ever had the honor of putting in my mouth. O.M.G. Venyse and I were practically clawing at the bowl to get the last of its creamy loveliness. But when you hit a home run so soon in the game the rest of a meal can seem at odds.  However I was not daunted. She ordered the New York Strip with a side of mashed potatoes (with good gravy...what exactly is that?) and roasted carrots; I the blackened Mahi [*back story to follow] topped with crab and a side of Israeli couscous. We didn't share our protein but we sampled each others sides. All were very good but the carrots really stood out. The gravy and the potatoes were good and I loved my couscous. But halfway through here steak and by the last few bites of my fish we both hit the wall. A food coma was certain. I persevered but Venyse relented and boxed the rest of her meat and carrots.  Then came the white chocolate brownie. So sweet so rich so topped with vanilla ice cream. It was all we could to to make a dent in it. We both felt bad because isn't white chocolate supposed to be their signature ingredient?   Regardless this was a terrific first restaurant to go with which to begin. And we both agreed it would be a place in our future dinner splurges. I also must admit I love LOVE the belt buckles. Having about 42 myself I was intrigued when I first noticed what I thought read \"SWAG\" after staring for perhaps too long in that general region of one of the staff. (Really super sorry if that creeped you out.) It's actually WCG.  [* When a group of us went to Key West one December to escape of the harsh winter of NWOhio and Detroit we went to a restaurant the listed \"Dolphin\" as one of its menu items. I asked in a slightly shocked voice if it was really dolphin to which the server responded it was actually Mahi. 'Oh' I responded. 'Then I'll have the veggie burger.' Because even in 1998 I was a food bitch.]
neg	Bad music slow service disgusting overpriced drinks and annoying patrons.  Definitely wouldn't come back if someone paid me to. I can't even drink this margarita.
pos	I am so not a fan of the dentist.  But Dr. Ito and his staff changed that.  Professional yet relaxed attitudes.  From the moment you book the appointment to the time you leave you feel like are well cared for and that you aren't just a number or a dollar sign.  While in the waiting area I flipped through Dr. Ito's \"Smile\" book that shows some of his work.  WOW!  He makes teeth look real not like Chiclets.  He does some fabulous cosmetic work!    I went in to have a crown put on and it was quick and painless. So quick that I didn't get to finish watching the movie!   Each chair has headphones and a flat screen that shows a movie (he keeps a good stock of the latest movies.).  Who'd have thought that going to the dentist would keep me so entertained?  I've had to bring my son to each appointment as I haven't had anyone to keep him.  Does that matter? Nope.  Dr. Ito's office is equipped with a children's area in the back where the kids can watch a movie read a book or play a game.  He thinks of everything.  I have been recommending him to everyone I meet.  I can't say enough good things about Dr. Ito and his staff.  You won't regret going to the dentist if Sonoran Hills Dental is your new dental office.
neg	I think they need to hire a better chief; the food doesn't taste right.  My mom said she can teach them how to cook for free.
pos	The best tai in downtown for the price! Masiman is the most tasty dish here!
neg	Never Again I brought my Mountain Bike in (which I bought 1 week earlier from Walmart) to have them replace my flat inner tubes with puncture resistant tubes.)  I came back 20 minutes later when they said it would be done and as I rode away the back tire rhythmically rubbed against the back brake.  When I returned and told them about it I was told the back wheel was not true.  It was true for the whole short week since I purchased it from Walmart.  I plan to take it to their competitor (Landis) and pay the extra $15-$25) to have the wheel put back to the straight condition it was in when I brought it to Slippery Pig in the first place.   I would never give a shop another penny for an extra service I should never have needed on a brand new bike which coasted perfectly when I brought it in.
pos	Man I love Southwest.  Best airline ever.  After a bunch of holiday delays on my way home from a business trip they comped us all a round of drinks.  It's nice to have an airline that can give you a glass of wine to compensate for a one hour delay.  Cheers to that!
neg	Went in for acrylics on Friday and it was horrible! I've been getting acrylics for years and it has never been a problem to have them filed down...until this time. The tip of one finger was filed down so bad that it's blistered. (At least the nail tech put some antiseptic on it so it's not infected.) Also when I put some lotion on my hands Tuesday a lot of my nails started getting sticky and filmy like they were going to disintegrate. NOT NORMAL! I removed mine today and found that my nails were finely filed so it looks like they would have fallen off soon anyway. I'm not going back there again.
pos	Excellent burger
neg	This used to be one of my favorite restaurants but the service went way down hill.  The new owners hire lots of college students with tattoos everywhere as well as lots of piercings.  Seems like tattoos and too many piercings are a job requirement along with disrespect and a lack of desire.  The staff is what made this place the worst restaurant ever and doesnt seem to matter how often you let management know I just dont think they care.  Also in the past few years there is a growing number of homeless that sit out front begging for money.  They sit so close to the outside patio that you have them dining with you or at least it feels that way making you incredibly uncomfortable.  Our last visit we sat on the patio which was next to a bench just outside the restaurant where a few homeless were stationed.  One girl had a huge rat on her shoulder and it was beyond disgusting.  Management obviously doesnt care and does nothing to improve anything so we go way out of our way now to eat at the other Greek in Chandler at Chandler Mall.
pos	Came here instead of Starbucks to get some much needed study time... It's too hot for coffee.. Close to my university ... Has all things berry healthy... I personally ordered the Berry Fulfilling w a free energy shot... Free!! I'll take berries and free any day.. My drink : all berry and only 150 mere cals..& filling.. Actually felt like dessert.. Awesomely sweet staff..
neg	1 star for service and attitude.The food was delicious  but the staff was very hateful. I am writing this review. I don't remember the waitresses name but I do remember that she was short  hispanic  and she was pregnant at the time. She was incredibly hateful.So hateful and rude to me and my parents. I do know why she did this is because I am transgendered. I was wearing leggings and I was carrying a black polo purse.   So I thought that this happened because of how I was dressed and how I looked  but that really wasn't the case.I went back 2 weeks later and I dressed differently. More \"manly\" (ha). Different waitresses  same great food  same hateful attitudes. I will stress to everyone reading this to save your time and money and go to a different pizza hut or a different pizza joint to get better service.
pos	I have found my new favorite breaksfast/lunch spot! I love the much cozier and homey feel this place has as opposed to chains like Panera and Corner Bakery. We stopped in at Wildflower Bread Company over the weekend because I had heard great reviews about their freshly baked loaves of bread. We were just going to pick up a couple specialty loaves since we needed bread at home anyhow. Instead we ended up staying for lunch after we got a peek at the menu and the dessert case.   My fiance ordered the salmon alfredo and he loved it. This said a lot to me because he's normally not a pasta person. The salmon itself was really good - soft and flavorful. I had the butternut squash ravioli - one of my all time favorite pastas - and WBC's version did not disappoint. I loved the nutmeg flavor it had - perfect complement to the creamy sauce and the butternut squash. Both dishes came with big slices of grilled toast. The pasta portion sizes itself were perfect. Just the right amount to feel satisfyingly full but not overly stuffed like the portion sizes at Cheesecake Factory or Macaroni Grill. We ended our meal by splitting a lemon bar which also was devoured down to the last crumb.  It was a later lunch for us (around 3pm) so it wasn't crowded inside but there were still a good amount of customers so it seems to be a favorite. Service was pleasant and fast and the menu has a wide variety of items that we're excited to go back and try more.
neg	Normally have had great service & food here but on Father's Day Nicole H was simply horrible.  Rude slow non-helpful etc.  Just a total fail.    A different food-deliverer brought out food and \"auctioned it off\" (didn't know who got what) and I asked for a refill on my empty water glass but he didn't bring it after 15 minutes and Nicole didn't notice so I had to bring it up to her.  Their bloody Mary's taste just like tomato juice with tobasco.  Nothing special at all.  And for $12???!?!?!??!?!  SHAME.  The coq au vin was great.  WHY IS THERE NO \"CONTACT US\"/e-mail address ON THEIR WEBSITE?????
pos	I saw this place on a Food Network series in November. When my family went to Phoenix in March for spring training I knew we had to stop here. It was the first stop after getting off the plane and getting the rental car. It was in a sketchy area in the town and far enough from the freeway. When we were there the workers gave us samples of the different foods. I got the chicken fried rice combo with jade red chicken and the pollo diablo. The pollo diablo had a nice spicy flavor and the jade red chicken was also very good. The snickerdoodle was very soft and chewy which was a good thing for me. This will be a permanent stop in Phoenix for Spring Training trips.
neg	The service at this location is absolutely atrocious. I went to the Starbucks to get a Frappuccino as I've done many times at this location without issue. The employee working the counter had an absolutely revolting tattoo near her collar bone and a scowl on her face. She asked me if I had a membership AFTER I had swiped my card then said \"Too late\" when I told her I had one.  Then the idiot with the spiky blonde hair made me a Frappuccino that was basically brown water. I told her to make it again. She made it again then informed me that she put extra shots of chocolate in it and I should ask for extra chocolate if I don't want it to taste like water. I have never had a problem with the way my drink tasted until that day but apparently the problem lies with me.  I'm not the one who chose a career in customer service. If the coffee slingers at this branch can't pretend to enjoy their jobs they should be put out on the street.
pos	This is the only auto repair place I've ever seen with 5 stars solid and they totally deserve it.  My boyfriend has a 1969 Pontiac Firebird that hasn't run in several years. After sinking lots of his own time into tinkering with it and $1000 to the awful Meineke down the street he gave up... until my car's transmission went for good and he decided to fix the Bird (yeah!) so I could drive it (yes I am super lucky!)  Whitey's diagnosed it as the carburetor dumping fuel (which is what Meineke charged $500 to replace.. hmmm...). Upon hearing the story of Meineke Whitey's told him to order the part himself to avoid the markup and they'd put it in for just labor.  Awesome!  We took it home but it wasn't running quite right still and then failed emissions. Back to the shop it went.  Whitey's took it back spent ALL WEEKEND on it doing various minor things. At one point they called and said \"We've done this this and this and it's still not quite right so we're gonna keep it another day.\"   I was glad they were admitting they actually felt it to be not right and were determined to fix it versus just handing it back again... but I was dreading the repair bill.  We picked it up Tuesday. The bill? $7. That's right - SEVEN DOLLARS. They only charged him for a spark plug and oil filter. That is amazing to me - I was expecting several hundred dollars for their time.    The car runs beautifully now and they were extremely pleasant the entire time. I'm taking my alleged defunct car to them for a second opinion next week. I HIGHLY recommend Whitey's!
neg	Treachery! Seek it out:  Let me begin this review by saying that mine is not an indictment on this particular location but on every single P.F. Chang's I've had the misfortune of being dragged to.  P.F. Chang's is effectively the Cheesecake Factory of bad Chinese food with the disadvantage of not being as capable of delivering passable food. They bill themselves as a \"gourmet\" Asian experience which is a bit of a laugh when they turn around and sell you their equally horrible frozen entrées right from the convenience of your local Wal-Mart. Everything is bland overcooked and ridiculously priced.   Once you've paid nearly $14 for their \"orange peel chicken\" you may privately hope to yourself that they might have the audacity to include some fried rice. This is your second mistake. Sadly the bistro calls you on your bullshit. You get white or brown--fried rice is several dollars extra and not at all worth it.  Everything seems to be cooked just wrong--things that shouldn't be are too crispy things that should be sauced are too dry things that should taste good make you question the will of the gods all the while you find there's no way to escape the treachery.  Things get more and more frustrating as you dig deeper: P.F. Changs while sounding vaguely Asian is a wholly American creation. It was founded by Paul Fleming (in Scottsdale actually) with SOMEone with some Asian influence to spice it up a bit named Philip Chiang. (They literally cut out the poor bastard's \"i\" so that it would \"fit on the signs better\" or as I like to believe not scare away the flyover-states-white-folk so.) It's highly Americanized (and yes I've had Chinese food in China but I've also enjoyed great \"American Chinese\" food here) to the point of regrettable blandness and it is SO VERY EXPENSIVE you may find your credit score taking a ding after eating a plate of \"wok charred beef\" listed as one of the saltiest foods in America.  The decoration is clumsy and their famous inclusion of terra cotta warriors are literally symbols of death. From Jennifer 8 Lee's Fortune Cookie Chronicles:  'But not everyone finds the terra-cotta warriors charming. \"Chinese people would never put that in a restuarant\" Jim told me pointing at the statues. \"It's not lucky. It's something you put at a burial site! But in America they think it's a Chinese thing.\" From a Chinese perspective P.F. Changs is decorated with death.'  Which is just fine because everything there tastes like death anyway.
pos	I've rented from Captain Ted many times and even gone on one of his guided trips down the Salt River. He is helpful and very knowledgeable and I would highly recommend renting here.
neg	I got on the internet and looked at the menu and called in the order. I informed Brother's that I had a $3 coupon also and would pick up the perpperoni pizza and sampler and they said it would be 20 minutes.  At the register I was charged $12.95 for the $8.95 sampler.  I told the cashier that the internet menu had it listed for $8.95.  She just smiled and said \"Oh we get that a lot but we don't have a menu.\"  I said \"but it's on the internet with your address/web page\"  and she said \"yeh I know we get that a lot but here's our menu\"  and she handed me their copy-machine menu which did not even have the sampler listed.  I politely told her that they should take the menu off the internet if it's not right.  The sampler was 4 pieces each of wings mushrooms cheese sticks zuchinni.  The sampler was just like frozen generic small pieces \"out-of-the-freezer-bag\" deep fried.     I live near and our family had hoped to make this our weekly outing for pizza; however I'll go elsewhere for better food and prices.  I also don't like false advertising.    A customer's frustration should be a business owner's learning opportunity to make their business better.  They can learn a lot from their customers.
pos	Have I got a place for you un-health conscious frugal foodies out there!  Rocket Burger and Subs serves up huge sandwiches and fried delights for astonishingly low prices and much of the food is home-made. There's also an enormous section of unusual soft drinks; for instance there's over two dozen brands of root beer to choose from. Dennis one of the owners worked for A&W for 8 years so he probably has root beer running through his veins by now.        I saw Rocket Burger in a listing of new valley eateries then did a little research. The reviews I saw were all stellar so I knew we had to give it a try. It doesn't look like much inside or out - it's in a little strip mall tucked behind Churches Chicken at 35th Ave. and Cactus. But it's clean and everybody is helpful and pleasant. Ken gave a happy whoop when he saw Cheese Curds ($2.49/$4.49) on the menu. We decided to get an order while waiting for our friends Randy and Marty to join us. The curds came quickly out of the kitchen piping hot served with some tasty homemade marinara. They were a touch greasy as they should be and the oil was fresh. Marty and Randy arrived in time to save us from ourselves by helping to finish off the curds. Then we took a while trying to make our selections from the extensive menu. Eventually Randy and I both went for the New Yorker: pastrami with homemade slaw and thousand island dressing ($2.99 $3.99 or $4.99). Ken had a homemade-meatball  sub with more of that good marinara and some provolone. It was the same price structure as our New Yorkers and all the rest of the entries under Classic Subs and Sandwiches. Marty went with a double burger ($3.89 the singles are $1 less). He could have opted for a Rocket Burger - !0 inch sub with three burgers and the fixings in either plain cheese bacon teriyaki or chili style ($4.99 to $5.99). Of course we had to try the fries and onion rings.       Again our food arrived quickly served in plastic baskets. It became very quiet except for the occasional growl of pleasure. The onion rings ($1.99) had been dipped in a thin cornmeal batter which made them nice and crunchy.  The handcut fries ($1.49) were skinny the way I like them. Randy thought they were undersalted but I thought they were fine - our usual disagreement. At any rate they disappeared quickly. Unlike the sandwiches. They were so big that we all ended up taking half of each sub home. The slaw on the New Yorkers was delicious as was my whole wheat sub roll. The meat balls were nice and tender and there was plenty of cheese on top. Randy had found a bottle of ginger beer imported from Australia that had a wonderfully refreshing true ginger taste. There seemed to be actual pieces of ginger in it - instructions on the label said to invert the bottle before opening. It never did tell you to turn it right side up again - the Aussies give us more credit than we deserve.        Other food items available: Hebrew National hot dogs in several styles ($2.49) Pizza   Bread with various toppings Gyros ($3.69) salads ($1.99 - $3.99) a fish sandwich ($2.49) served with homemade tartar sauce. And lots more. I don't know how Dennis and Steve manage to turn out food of this quality for so little money but I surely do hope they continue and prosper!
neg	I can't even believe I actually went to this restaurant.  My feeling was that if the Tommy Bahama clothing and its wearers were any indication of the dining experience it was going to be unoriginal and in poor taste.  Alas my friend wanted to go there was his birthday lunch so....  Let me be clear that I'm not a food snob at all.  Just last week I enjoyed a lunch of Nachos Bell Grande and a bean and cheese burrito at Taco Bell very very much.  That was far superior to this lunch at Tommy Bahama.   The decor was comfortable and breezy.  Everything else  - not so much.  1st it's nice that they bring you bread and butter but a sweetly flavored butter?  Why mess with the pure goodness of butter?  The glass of lemonade I ordered was sickeningly sweet and I am a notorious for my sweet tooth.  It was undrinkable until I cut it with water.  The coconut shrimp also had an overly sweet sauce.  So much so that we could each only eat 1 of 6 shrimp.  I got the crab bisque which was crazy salty and in my opinion contained previously frozen hence rubbery crab meat.    As it was my friend's birthday they brought him a complimentary dessert.  Very nice. He got the newest one which was some sort of chocolate/caramel-filled cake with oreo crust chocolate mousse topping sprinkled with crushed Heath bar.  Sounds good right?  Vile absolutely vile.  Overly sweet except for the oreo crust that was saturated in butter.  On an update note - it was not the nasty sweet butter they serve with the bread though.      My final issue was with our young highly attentive server.  He was very sweet and well-intentioned.  However I feel that every server in the world needs to stop speaking to customers in the collective.  Don't say \"are we enjoying our coconut shrimp?\" or \"are we ready for dessert?\"  Unless I've badly misinterpreted our relationship \"we\" aren't doing anything together. Just a pet peeve -  I still tipped him 22\% and kept my mouth shut about this odd little quirk.    oh and the bill for coconut shrimp appy quesadilla cup of crab bisque lemonade and glass of white wine?  $52.  for lunch.    Tommy Bahama and I just didn't work out at all.
pos	I've been going to La Canasta for as long as I can recall. I live in Tempe and can't go as often as I'd  like but I go at least once a month. I love this Canasta because they have a green chile salsa and menudo every day! Always quick and fresh. I either get the ground beef tacos (yummy) the red chile burrito (watch out) or the menudo (got a hangover?). It is very consistent and prices well it adds up but it is worth it. I have yet to have a bad experience after 28 years!
neg	My office moved to the area so I was driving around and saw the sign \" Best Sandwich....\" Um no. If you want I can come in there and show you how to cook a Chicken Cheese steak. First don't wrap it up and let the sandwich sweat and make the bun soft and chewy. Second put some meat on there. It was 50\% bun.  It should be toasted and crunchy. And price a 12\" chicken cheese chips and drink was $13..are you kidding me. For that price I was hoping for the best I ever had. Change it up Capriottis or the word will get out and it will all be over in this very tough market.
pos	It cannot get any better than this my favorite is mix of banana  hazelnut and lemon. It is quality stuff. If you want something better fly to Italy.
neg	Cummings took over the company that we originally used and since they have taken over we have had nothing but problems.  I haven't seen a single bug in years in my house and as soon as we started using Cummings we've found a bug almost every single day and not just 'bugs' but cockroaches. I called Cummings to ask them about why this was happening and the receptionist was extremely rude saying they didn't do anything wrong. I would NEVER recommend this company to anyone.   Needless to say I will be finding a new pest control company today.
pos	Visited the phoenix public market - open air market - farmers market they have on saturday mornings and decided to give mojo bowl a try! They are at the market for food truck fridays also. Check out their website for their usual schedule. They can take cash or credit (with square).  I tried their strawberry banana smoothie and my wife had the Funky Monkey (peanut butter / chocolate blend). They were both great quality with fresh ingrediants. They serve salads yogurt parfaits and soup also (which I didn't try) but Ive heard their smoothies was where they shine and they did not dissapoint. Give them a try at $5.00 for a 24 oz smoothie you can't really complain about the price - its basically a meal itself.
neg	For the past three months I've been receiving unsolicited spam text messages from these clowns so regardless of how nice a place this might be I'll never stay with them or any other affiliated property for that reason alone. I've complained to the hotel (I was blown off) blocked them from my cell phone account and filed a complaint with the feds. So...since the hotel continues to find it appropriate to light up my cell phone at 3 am with spam texts I hereby award them a generous one-star rating.
pos	what is it with me and pricey phoenix hotels? i swear i don't just give out fives willy nilly or do i have any particular adoration for phoenix.  (sorry phx.)   I went to the Valley Ho on an amazing business trip that involved rock stars and the Oakland Athletics which happen to be my favorite team. it was downright magical.   the decor was fantastic the rooms were huge with huge tubs a poolside patio and a comfy chaise lounge. the flatscreen TV had an iPod doc! yaaaaay! (why don't more hotels do this?)   the pool was phenomenal. i sat around for days on couches drinking bloody mary's and frozen drinks. the lobby bar had a deadly but wonderful drink called the stardust.   The trader vic's attached isn't so hot but i generally liked all the food i got from the pool bar and the restaurant ZuZus. (room service too- they make their own english muffins!!!)  If i'm comparing it to the royal palms the other phoenix resort i raved about it's tough. Royal Palms is better for chilling and families; Valley Ho is better for singles. Royal Palms is your wedding; Valley Ho the bachelorette party. Valley Ho had better food and more style but Royal Palms had a bit more to it and better service. Really you can't go wrong with either.   What is it about Phoenix hotels??? all i know is i am no longer groaning when i'm sent on a business trip there!
neg	I really wanted to like this place.  For starters I paid cash for my take out. I was owed back five dollars and was told \" we don't have enough change\". So I had to settle for $2.50. What kind of restaurant doesn't have proper change?  Especially on a Saturday night.        The food:  Chicken lettuce wraps had a strange fishy taste. Gave up on them after a few bites.  Vegetable chow mein:  In my opinion a broun sauce is thick and flavorful. This one was very liquidy and flavorless.  Dumplings were edible at best.       Do yourself a favor and stick with China Chili.
pos	This is my dad and I favorite lunch spot. Pho-real! Impeccable service and the freshest food. Their spring rolls ate immaculate fried rice is pretty close to Peruvian friend rice and their pho is truly unphoghetable. The servers are friendly the owner always asks you how the food was. Nestled inside the Mekong plaza market this place will meet all your expectations in delicious Vietnamese cuisine.
neg	This place has NO clue when it comes to pricing men's items and I would not recommend them at all.  I consigned a leather briefcase worth close to $600 and they priced it for $90 giving me a whopping take-home of $40.  I understand the need to move merchandise quickly (and naturally this sold in a matter of days) but cannot fathom why they would not attempt to get more money for the item.  I can only assume they did not do their research before setting the price.  Consigner beware!
pos	CASH ONLY!  But we easily feed a family of 4 hungry people for less than $20 and it's not Taco Bell.  So with that being said... the Grilled Pork #5 sandwich... oh hell ya... it's good ringing in at only $2.85.  The regular Turkey / Ham on a crossaint is about $4.25 and it's the size of a small football... great value... you could probalby get by with the small croissant sandwich instead for  only $1.95... yeah... it's crazy cheap.  Hot wings are generic prebreaded with a kick of spiciness.   The steamed bun is sweet dough..however not my favorite... my husband and sister seem to love the egg and meat inside.  The ice cream is all homemade...also another great deal at $.99 cents for a cone... check out the icecream...looks crazy good.  Don't miss out on taking home some baked goods... the baguettes are crusty-soft and warm when you get them.  The croissants are delicious and some of the better ones here in the valley.  I did try and Avacodo boba...had to send it back...not sure what the heck it was...it was green... but didn't taste anything like Avacado... so I did head across the way to Boba tea house for my bobas.  The Viet coffee also great kick for you mentally if you need a boost very strong=very good.  Don't miss out on this place... it's a good go to place for a great lunch or snack.
neg	Currently having a liquidation sale but it's not really worth the trip.  I found that most books were cheaper at Amazon then the sale price.  A few were even cheaper at Barnes and Noble then the liquidation sale price!  Which just made me say to myself well that's probably why you're going out of business try some competitive pricing!  The place is an absolute disaster they've moved a lot so the sales staff doesn't even know where everything is.  Also the place just smells dirty and old it's very unwelcoming.  It's really no surprise to me they couldn't get customers before.
pos	Had a late night plumbing emergency last night. Called a friend who recommended Kevin's Classic Plumbing. Within an hour the plumber was at my home repairing my problem. At 10:00pm my water was back on with kids taking showers toilets being flushed and my wife was talking to me again. Sounds great right? Get's even better! The price they charged me for the after hours repair was the most reasonable ever. Last but not least he was a heck of a nice guy. Kevin's Classic Plumbing will be my plumbing company for both home and work from now on.  On another note... I had called one of those companys that advertise on TV all day long. They were not able to come out last night and when they did call me they indicated that it was probably not something they could fix and would most likely require a two man crew. Thanks Parker & Son's.
neg	I give this place NO stars. They have karaoke which would be good except for the co-host is NASTY! The rest of the bar is typical with darts pool and poker. The food SUCKS! don't bother to go here unless you like being whined at by a wussy faggot at night long. I know that is harsh but the co-host really is nasty.
pos	The best fish tacos period!  And I hate chain restaurants!
neg	I will never go back to this establishment because all of the bouncers and wait staff are unfriendly unprofessional and disrespectful.
pos	This is hands down the best burrito in the East Valley! Fav's is always consistent and their prices are excellent! My standard meal is a California Carne Asada burrito it comes with the most tender carne asada I've ever had. Also their green and red sauce is a step above the competition and they have great mexican rice it comes with peas and carrots! Guac is exceptional and they also have really tasty breakfast burritos that are available all day. Five stars for being consistent clean and for having pleasant and professional employees! One more thing is that they close at midnight except for Sunday when they close at 10. Bummer but still the best!
neg	Let me first say if I could have given 0 stars I would have.  My wife and I went to this place and were EXTREMELY disappointed. We had gone to a different Pancho's many years ago and were hoping it would be like that. The choices were very very limited and basic. There are so many amazing Mexican dishes yet my only choices were a tamaletaco and some horrible tasting enchiladas. How does a Mexican food place not offer burritos...have you guys heard of a bean burrito? Its pretty popular and would be a good choice to offer.  The only food here that is worth eating is the baby churros and the Sopapillas which actually were good. Unfortunately I didn't go to this place to pay $20 so my wife and I can eat Sopapillas.   Please listen to my advice when I tell you to avoid this place. Take your money to taco bell and get a lot better Mexican food at a fraction of the cost.
pos	After a second visit the chicken was a little dry and lacked flavor. Quite a contrast to my first visit. Still enjoyed the meal but wasn't as impressed with the chicken. I'll have to go back to see if it was a fluke.
neg	One word to describe Over Easy: disappointing.   It would've been an OK breakfast place if it wasn't for all the hype. I've been trying to visit this place since I found out it was on Diners Drive-ins and Dives so when I saw the deal on Doozy of a Deal I purchased it right away. I made my own omelette with chicken garlic and spinach. The chicken was overcooked and the omelette and my hash browns were terribly greasy. My cousin ordered The Wolfpack and was also disappointed with her meal. It just didn't seem up to par with a place that was on Food Network.  The icing on the cake was the Over Easy Ice their iced coffee. They could've given me a cup of water and cardamom and it wouldn't have tasted any different. We couldn't wait to get to the car to get some gum to get the taste out of our mouths and even that didn't help. After reading other people's reviews it looks like they hardly had any caradmom; so looks like Over Easy needs to figure out a way to uniformly make their coffee.  Sorry Over Easy you were quite disappointing.
pos	I would be beside myself if Grinders closed. It's about time I wrote a review since I'm a regular. I can be found sitting on one of the giant chairs surfing on the wi-fi many mornings.  I'm the one who brought the plants in. I used to water them a couple times a week but nowadays I'm lazy and they really need to be repotted. I should get on that ...  The music is always playing and everyone knows my regular drink ... they've continued to memorize it for me even as I started to slowly decrease the fat & calories of my regular order. Now it's an ice skim latte with sugar free vanilla. I used to get an Everything bagel with egg cheese and potatoes most mornings. Now I get it on multigrain toast. Eh it's the little things.  The coffee at Grinders is really really good. It's not bitter and sharp it's smooth. They grind their beans outside many mornings per week. Sometimes it gets too warm inside during the winter so we prop the doors open but if the grinder is going outside it'll blow coffee bean fumes in the door.  There's some retired motorcycle cops who meet up every morning and sit around the big round table. They often park their motorcycles in front of the place together. They call themselves the Geezerados.  There's sometimes a few right-wingers having conversations mid-day. One time I listened to their meeting and heard them trying to come up with controversial topics to get people to come to church. They spent a long time trying to figure out who could get them proof that global warming isn't happening so they could use that as their hook.  A lot of moms come in with their kids. Seeing siblings piled up in one of the oversized chairs together is common. There are a few regulars who come in specifically to sit on the internet all day. I'm not there all day but I'm there at all times of the day because I have a home office and you never know when you suddenly need caffeine.  Early in the morning and after 3pm the place becomes flooded with Sunnyslope High School kids. They range from ROTC kids wearing pickle suits to trendy girls in neon to the alternative crowd. They often lay around the couch splayed across each other or gazing into each others' eyes.   Ordinarily I'm a real talker and I can't usually keep my mouth shut but Grinders is the one place that I go where I barely make a peep. I just eavesdrop on everyone's conversations and sometimes run into friends I know. I usually go before my brain is fully awake in the morning that's part of it. For the record a couple months ago one of the girls there said I was practically invisible and she hardly knew I was there because I was so quiet.  There's nothing pretentious about Grinders at all and it's also down to earth without being ghetto. It has character. Some months the art is better than other months. Hannah has been there for years (they call her Big Hannah now only because there's another girl named Hannah who is tiny and they call her Little Hannah) and Hannah rocks and makes the best breakfast ever.   I can ride my bike in the morning and be wearing my pajamas and not have anyone really bat an eye. That's the beauty of Grinders. I've seen other people come in wearing their pajamas too. It's a little bit like the cafeteria in a college dorm except the people are of all ages and we live down the street from each other instead of down the hall from each other.  Grinders has a location inside the John C. Lincoln hospital across the street too. It's common to see the hospital workers walk in wearing their scrubs. I think they're also opening one at Devry or they just did. I was frustrated to hear that they tried to open a location at the Art Institute but they were one week too late Stupid Starbucks had just gotten there. LAME!
neg	I've been here 3 times.  The first was fair so I gave it another shot second time fair again third time (kyoto was closed soooo....) let me start by saying I've been in the service industry for awhile.  I know the difference between good and bad service.  If they had been busy this would be one thing but there was us and a few people at the bar.  NEVER HAVE I WANTED TO THROW MY BURGER AT SOMEONE AS MUCH AS OUR SERVER.  The server was an idiot and the food was ALL burnt... medium burgers are not CHARRED on the outside and RAW on the inside.  Steamed veggies are not CHARBROILED asparagus... everything was so horrible.  We didn't complain but we did ask about the charcoal that was our veggies....  Which we were given a crappy attitude in response.  We weren't even looking for it to be taken off our bill just a recognition that the food was TOTALLY burned and half our orders were wrong. BTW there was no offer made either to fix anything...  in times like these SERVICE SERVICE SERVICE AND QUALITY / CONSISTENCY will get you through.   if you don't know what a good meal is and you want to think you're cool cause you hang out in a place that looks like it was furnished by IKEA you should try it.  There are better places to spend hard earned money.
pos	In my opinion one of the best steakhouses in town.  My husband and I go here for all our special occasions and have never had one bad meal.  The service is the best just like their steaks.  I recommend the Caesar salad fillet creamed spinach cream corn garlic and lobster mashed potatoes.  We will continue our tradition and keep coming back here.
neg	Can someone please tell me why people go here???  Went to breakfast with Deb L and she had a Living Social deal or one of those deal thingies. The place was packed probably because it's a holiday week.  That doesn't excuse the EXTREMELY poor service. We sat down and waited. And waited. Servers walked by every few moments nobody stopped to fill our water glasses or take our order. Finally we both said something to a girl who walked by. She seems mystified that there was a job to do. With that many people working getting a cup of coffee shouldn't take 15 minutes. Yes. 15 freaking minutes.  Food? Mediocre at best. I got the traditional eggs benedict with home fries. The only saving grace with the amount of ham on it. The English muffin didn't seem to be toasted. The eggs were *ok* but nothing great. The home fries? My 9-year old niece could do a better job. My burps right now aren't even good enough to brag about.  I'm sure if the service had been better I wouldn't be so miserable right now. My food coma isn't satisfying. I will *never* go here again. Ever. I felt stupid leaving a tip it was THAT bad.   Total. Fail. Blech.
pos	We have been here many times in the last 10+ years. The Stetson Salad is the best salad I have ever had. The combination of sweet crunchy savory and acidic is perfect to me. Lately I have also tried the Scallops on Beet risotto. The scallops are great but the risotto just doesn't work though I love beets and I love risotto.  I have of course had the mushroom stir fry which is very good but very hearty and heavy. Soups have been excellent. The current best desert is that peanut butter brownie. But beware...it is really rich and sweet. I also enjoy the wine flights here. Most recently I took my 8 and 11 year olds at lunch. Though they were the only kids there they thoroughly enjoyed the Kobe beef burgers. This is still my favorite place in Old Town.
neg	Soggy flavorless pizza served on unwarmed ceramic plate. Carbonara was watery and made with cream instead of eggs. Gnocchi was tough as opposed to light and airy.
pos	This place literally just opened.  I didn't really know what to expect but when I walked in the doors I was immediately greeted by Nick and he was very nice and down to earth.  This is a shop for people who like to garden/grow plants hydroponically or in the ground. They have all kinds of gardening supplies and Nick said they will be receiving their seed shipment from Seeds of Change any day now.  I will definitely be back as my green thumb (or lack thereof) has been sparked:)  P.S. I was informed that the in the next issue of the New Times Grotown will have an add to clip out and bring in to save 20\% !!Yay plants:)
neg	Water park is OK.  However the parking lot has ZERO security.  No security patrols no cameras.  My catalytic converters were stolen off my truck in the parking lot at Big Surf Tempe today.  Sawed right off in broad daylight.  According to the cops car break ins and catalytic converter thefts happen frequently here.  BEWARE!  The water park management doesn't give a shit.  Even the cop laughs because they always say the same thing:  \"Our camera is broken but it's getting fixed next week\".  What a joke.  If you go have someone drop you off.  You've been warned!
pos	FnB is how every restaurant should be. Unfortunately this will not happen because Pavle Milic who runs the place cannot be at every restaurant.   This is a small friendly restaurant in my hood that just happens to have some of the best food you will find. I always feel welcomed & taken care of by the staff. I've come here with friends but I've also come alone & felt totally welcome. I like sitting up at the counter and I've actually met some really great people to chat with there. Pavle & his wife run the place & they are the kind of people who always make you feel like they are glad you are there.  Chef Charlene does things with food that make it amazing & these are things that I myself could never accomplish. My main cooking skills involve a microwave or a menu. I just wish I had the funds to eat here more often.  In conclusion fabulous food combined with wonderful service make me feel lucky to have FnB in my neighborhood. :)
neg	Absolutely awful... these guys have NO idea what they are doing!
pos	I LOVE Laser for Less (Chandler)!  If you are going anywhere else for Laser hair removal you need to stop now and call to make an appointment with Laser for Less Chandler.   I wasted a lot of $$$ at another Laser removal place before I found Laser for Less and now I am kicking myself for not going to them first.  If you pay to wax any part of your body you should be lasering that hair off.  It works better lasts longer and in the long run is cheaper.    Pros -  1. Free touch ups 14-18 days after your first appointment if they missed 1 hair they will touch up for free.  Never had a problem with them discouraging me in fact it was the opposite they give me reminder cards so I know when my touch ups are due.  They encourage you to come in. 2. They can also charge you by the laser shot instead of a whole area.  So if you only have a few random hairs they will just charge 10 cent per shot on the legs or 70 cents on the face or smaller areas.  You can't beat that deal. 3. I am pretty sure they beat or match all prices in town. 4. Once they laser the hair all your hair will fall out and wont grow back for like 2 months its better than waxing.  Not all laser removal places use the type of laser that does this place does.  That is why I recommend them it works a lot better! 5. They actually care about getting rid of unwanted hair and will go over all their policies with you.  Kristen is who I go to and she is great.  I have been to almost all their girls and they are good.  6. In fact when it was my birthday month I didn't know I got some discount and they back credited me for it I feel like they are always trying to get me the best deal.   7. They always have deals.  Just last month they had their underarm extravaganza where you can get your underarms done for $30!!! That is so cheap.  They let you buy up to 3 sessions.  I referred a friend and she loved it so much because she didn't have to shave her underarms the WHOLE summer.   8. I love Laser for Less CHANDLER!!!  Cons - never having to shave again darn.
neg	Do not go to this car wash. I dropped my kids off at choir and thought I'd run in for a quick car wash. Oh no! They locked my keys in the car. I couldn't get On-Star to unlock my Suburban because it was under a huge canopy and couldn't get a signal. Instead of calling a locksmith the car washers tried and tried to get in through the window. Thankfully my husband was able to leave work early go retrieve the kids from choir practice and then come rescue me at the car wash with a spare set of keys. I was trapped there over an hour!  The manager then had the audacity to get mad at me because I was upset at their incompetence. They didn't even comp the car wash!  If you go here don't pay for your car wash until your car is done!
pos	Excellent service and food.  Best tex-mex in the valley.
neg	i called them and they wanted to charge $30 for fingerprints!!!!!  What a joke.  I found a place on the other side of the air park who did it for $10.  Caveat Emptor!  If if could give them a zero rating I would have.  On the other side of the airpark off of Greenway-Hayden loop is Global Pi Security.  $10 for prints. Their address is 7807 East Greenway road suite 9 Scottsdale Az.  globalpi-security (dot) com.  Good luck.
pos	This store has the most pleasant employees of any Forever 21 I have ever been to. The girls are always smiling and they take the time to esquire if you need help. The other day I went in and an employee spent over 10 minutes helping me locate a particular skirt my sister wanted for Christmas.
neg	Just called at 9:45 to ask when they were open until. Woman said they were already closed but website says open until 10 pm. Really?? Obviously don't care about patronage...mexican is a dime a dozen in the new NEW Mexico...no thanks. Next!
pos	I love cupcakes. Its true. I really do. I have waited in an hour long line outside of Magnolia Bakery in NYC to experience the bakery that started the cupcake craze. That said if there is a good cupcake to be had I'm on my way to experience it. I must note- that I am not a fan of Sprinkles; as I think they are overly dry and waayy too hyped.  We just ordered two dozen different flavors from Mind Over Batter to celebrate our August birthdays (its a tradition we do once a month from baker's around town). Because of my love for all thinks coffee- I got the Carmel Mocchiato. Let me just say- i wished I took a picture. But I couldn't help but to dive in. Mocha Buttercream frosting-piled high crushed coffee toffee and carmel drizzle.   I also heard rave reviews from the office about the Birthday Cake and the Chocolate Red Velvet. The one I most want to try is the Lemon Drop (because I love lemon).  I'll be back in very soon to check out more flavors and cake pops.
neg	I am leaving this store angry and can't resist writing a review!   The staff is incredibly useless....if you can actually find someone to help you. The store is huge with very little signs to guide you. Therefore I always wander aimlessly looking for the one simple thing I stopped in for (even though I tell myself I will never go back) with no one to help me.   Today they were out of an item I bought last week and need more of to finish my project. I asked the only 100 year old lady I could find to check the back and she told me they have nothing in back and to ask customer service. The lady at customer service was actually a reasonable age and when I asked her to call the Indian Bend store she handed me their number and said \"well you can call them\". I stormed out soooo mad and this time I promise to never go back. Hobby Lobby or Michaels is worth the drive!!!
pos	I love this place! Everything about it! The great food the grocery section the cramped seating (it gives character). It all goes together perfectly. Haven't found one bad thing yet:)
neg	New N. Scottsdale location Baaaaaaad!  The were 10 staff members milling around and there was no manager on sight.  $10.00 for a mediocre burger with an uncooked tasteless bun not large enough to encompass all the arugula.  They forgot the sauce which apparently is the main ingredient.  The upgrades are ridiculous.  $1.00 here for cheese on an already \"well priced\" burger (btw Flemings blue cheese/bacon burger $6 best in town) $500 here for fries.  C'mon.  And it's the same two hispanic guys who don't have any idea about chef inspired food cooking in the kitchen as every other restaurant there is no chef For the price you want to see the chef/owner representing especially at a new location and you want competent staff who treats you as #1 and not their conversing with the other staff members as #1 and you want to enjoy what is supposed to be one of the best burgers in town!  What a disappointment.  The lack of top down management care and supervision carries through in all elements of the poor experience.  Take a pass.
pos	Best Chinese food in the Valley. As others have said salad dressing is addictive as IS available to take home in containers. Shrimp dishes are outstanding with large plump high quality pieces of shrimp. I have never had even an average dish here. Go and enjoy!
neg	I wrote a less than stellar review about this place some time ago and decided that my prior awful experience might have been a fluke and as I love great BBQ decided to give them another go .....  I was right the first time!  As before the food was ho-hum at best the prices too high vs the product quality but the death blow to me was once again their customer service or shall I say lack of customer service?  We had to ask the bartender if we could get a drink (That's odd) and all the wait staff acted like they were doing us a favor by waiting on us.  To top it all off they had little to no air conditioning so it was brutal to sit through a combination of bad food crummy service and high heat!!!  For me this place is officially off the books and we sure won't be back. Lesson # 1: \"Your in the service industry try and acy like it\"  As a BBQ fan I'll try elsewhere ...............
pos	Here's the deal. I said I was done with OT but a friend told me the management had changed and it was worth another shot.   My friend was right.  Everything I had a problem with before was remedied. I went in unannounced didn't tell anyone about a previous bad experience and I was given some of the best service I've received in town. When we went in we were sat quickly and tended to very well for our entire visit.  No texting employees no indifferent waitstaff. The chef was in the food window expediting food making sure it went out promptly and correctly. Not only was our server attentive but there was a team service atmosphere and other servers came by our table when we had empty drinks debris on the table etc.   The decor has been refreshed and although I didn't dislike the decor originally it is definitely an upgrade as well. Now its much cleaner but still maintains the character that was part of its charm before.   Props to the new management. Well done. I'll be back.  PS - forgot to order side syrup. Curious to see if they still charge $2.
neg	Groupon rip-off. Small salad three extremely small plates of mediocre pasta desserts that cloyed the palate. All for an advertised value of $90. Will NEVER return.
pos	Have alread posted a review but had to add that a friend at work ordered vegan chocolate cupcakes for my birthday and they were sooooooo delicious!! All my nonvegan coworkers LOVED them.
neg	I found Lisa G's while driving through phoenix with a friend. The exterior looked promising and we prepared ourselves for a treat. We were in for a a shock! We ordered the antipasto plate and while there were serious issues with it it turned out to be the best thing we were served. I ordered the chicken rolatini (the special of the day) and it was just plain bad! The chicken was dry and under seasoned the Rosemary potatoes were soggy  and the veggie medley  (squash corn green beans etc.) was over cooked and the juices spilled over into the potatoes. It was one of the worst $17 meals that I have ever had! My friend ordered the veggie salad and it was one literal hot mess. Just horrible food! I see that others had the mini burgers and bowl of balls and found them to be tasty. I wish I had ordered those. As it is this is one place I would never revisit or recommend to a friend!
pos	The BEST SPORTS BAR in chandler hands down!! A great place to meet friends and even bring the kids!! The owners are always around to ensure ur experience!!

neg	I purchased the Enotria groupon when it was released last year and had a horrible experience at the restaurant.  1) I ordered a cheese platter. The platter was very much overpriced at over $18.00. The most problematic thing is that Enotria ordered the food from another restaurant on Mayo Blvd and had it delivered to them. The same is true with Pizza. If you order pizza there it will be delivered from another restaurant in the Mayo shopping plaza. Enotria is taking a significant markup on the food because they are paying another vendor for it. AVOID THIS!!  2) Another disturbing aspect of the visit was that we were served disproportionately small portion because we were using a groupon. We ordered two glasses of red wine. The waiter (who also happened to be the owner) served us a glass that was 1/3 of what is typically served.  The only positive aspect of Enotria is that they have a good selection of wines. To be sincere you are much better off going to a more reputable establishment in the area like White Chocolate Grill.  Oh also keep in mind that the current owner bought the restaurant over a year ago. It has changed ownership several times and the overall quality is suffering because of this.  AVOID.
pos	Beautiful restaurant! Terrrific service!   Wonderful fresh and authentic cuisine - what more can I say but don't miss the Carpaccio!
neg	please please please do not stay here!  i never do these reviews but i feel obligated to save someone the time and money and self respect by writing this review! the customer service is soooo soooo poor!! after having almost 500.00 held on my charge card after i checked out i called to find out why this charge was on my account.  i was hung up on and after calling back was repeatedly hung up on and refused to provide his name to me or his managers name! i told him i work at a four star hotel and casino in las vegas (which i do). he called me a liar! .. and as of right now still out 500.00! what establishment hangs up on their guests? this guy should sit through some of the forbes training i have received! what if i was a shopper?  do not stay here! save your money! they only received one star because you have to provide a rating.   aside from the horrible customer service they stuck me with a 50 penalty fee when i had to change locations. that wasnt great but whatever the pictures do not resemble the motel. the \"game room\" is not a game room.  its a room with an atari in it.  the pool was small and dirty and if you like noise all night while you are trying to sleep you can count on it here.  all these things i could get over. however the customer service the man (i cant even say gentleman) on the phone was horrible and penalty should follow. he is an embarrassment to all of us who work in guest services.  do not stay here! you would have a better stay in a box outside on a corner. i should have known better for such an inexpensive place but i was hoping if we cut back on the hotel we could spend extra money with the kids doing activities and going places... wrong! you get what you pay for... and worse!
pos	I've always been treated well @ D'ambrosio's despite my not exactly being 'N Scottsdale plastic'. :)
neg	I had such high expectaions after reading reviews but I was so disappointed.  The food was not good the service was awful.  They got all of our orders mixed upo. Will never go back and cannot recommend this place.  PS  one dish was good and some enjoyed the soup.  There are 100 places I will visit before returning to this place.
pos	Ben & Jerry's is still the best chain ice cream shop! The employees are always helpful and polite and their flavors are just outrageous! The smell of the waffle cones and waffle bowls wafts out the doors as you walk by and you can't resist. Whether you go for new flavors or classics like Cherry Garcia and Phish Food you can expect the most flavorful ice cream with the perfect consistency.
neg	If you want a school that cares more about your financial aid money than you this is the school for you. Education is horrible. If you are a democrat don't speak your mind; you will be considered a reject from day one. I got 100\% on my graduate papers and think I did not contribute anything to the fields. This institution is a joke.
pos	Did you know that Malee's on Main offers cooking classes!?  They offer them twice a month during tourist season and once per month during the rest of the year.  I attended two weeks ago and it was OUTSTANDING!  Not only did we learn to cook Thai (which incidentally it was significant to learn that Thai gets its flavor by layering is sauces) but we were given the recipes for some of the signature dishes served tastings a meal and wine pairings and we were even given goody bags.  It was a great way to spend a Saturday afternoon with another foodie!
neg	My husband and I went there for our first time today. What a mistake. First of all the ladies bathroom had no soap or paper towels to wash/dry your hands. My husband had the steak sandwich and I had the chicken ranch. There was so little meat on the sandwiches that we were perplexed when we were finished.  The inside trash was overflowing. I have been sick to my stomach the last hour....never again.
pos	Even though I've rarely had anything else on their menu except for hummus I highly recommend this little greek hot spot. They have tons of regulars because the food keeps them coming back. The hummus is to die for (it only comes with one pita however so I always order 2-3 extra). I have also tried their veggie gyro which is great. I have brought many meat-loving friends here and I've never heard anything but great things about their experience with their food.   The staff is completely Greek. They are friendly in their own unique kind of way. Because I usually saunter in with a drink from Starbucks (same parking lot) the female owner assumes I work there and she always asks me how business is going at SB. I corrected her the first few times but she continued to ask so now I just keep it going and tell her it's going great but that I hate my job (because I'm assuming I would if I worked there). I love her personality...very intense. Never smiles even when a smile would be just right. But she is still very kind. Always look forward to seeing her and eating her food.
neg	I will make this real easy for you.   Just go to in-and-out Burger if you don't want to feel gross and poor.
pos	I came here hoping to catch brunch but I guess it ends at 11:30am or 12pm. Luckily the lunch menu looked just as tasty. We ordered the Luau pulled pork sandwich (the jalapeno cole slaw gives it a nice kick) and the Monte Cristo (french toast instead of regular bread slices = delicious). Service was friendly and attentive. The dining area is decorated like a household- very comfortable and clean.
neg	\"The office space layout presentation gets 5 stars the customer service you receive from the employees at Corporate Office Center is a negative 10. They will scare your clients off scare your own staff and make your life a living hell. Their office locations and space is beautiful but if a say a client shows up at a time other than their scheduled time they will be told to leave. They will be told you don't provide any services at the locations and if anyone could single handedly ruining your professional image Corporate Office Centers can do this for you! BE AFRAID!!!! They are dedicated to working against not with you.\"
pos	My husband and I enjoyed a \"staycation\" here for my birthday. We had an amazing time! We took advantage of the great happy hour specials at the poolside bar and at the Sangria bar. The Sangria bar had billiards and a card table. They also had a wonderful Happy Hour menu where everything is $5. Excellent hamburgers and margaritas. We enjoyed a beautiful  dinner at Palm Court and a breakfast buffet at Vista Verde. We took advantage of the free bike rentals and the exercise facility. The staff was amazing and very accommodating. They have definitely earned our business and will refer our friends.
neg	Door clearly says drive-thru open 24 hours and lobby till midnight. Drove up at 10:30 and was told the lobby was closed...lame...
pos	Okay if you actually like the taste of good whole foods and fresh ingredients this place is an Oasis of goodness. If your looking for a place that says they make natural foods but uses 2nd rate ingredients and comes up with recipes to hide the fact by using spices to cover it up your better off going somewhere else. My family took me here when we were visiting and it is wonderful. I had the Pesto Presto sandwich and it was divine! I also tried my family's strawberry fields salad and Arizona rolls. They were all really good. The vegetables were fresh and high quality and the price for the portion and quality was a good price. I was amazed that they had a couple of options for people on the raw foods diet. The juices are different but surprisingly refreshing. This place is a great example that eating well and health can be tasty and satisfying.
neg	Coffee-meh. Not great not horrible. Scone-dry. Service-ridiculously slow. The night we were there (8/11) the owner came and asked a group of people (who were clearly having some sort of meeting) to stop talking because they were \"disturbing the guitar player.\" Chased 8 paying customers (at least I assume they were paying customers; they all had drinks) out the door. Weird!! Don't think I'll be going back.
pos	Just perfect !!!  For what it is!!!  Down to the Edison light bulbs from rejuvanation!!
neg	I would've gone 2 stars if I were more forgiving. I could reason that it was the end of the day that a big crowd of wayward children had just come through or that a hurricane had blown out the back of the restaurant. But then I tasted it.  It looks as if Yogurtini is pretty well-loved around these parts and I'm sorry to report otherwise. It's was like a bomb had gone off. The tables were filthy the machine handles were all gunked up there was assorted debris on the floor. The two teenagers working were too busy gossiping about who knows what to do their jobs. When we walked in there were a few customers sampling flavors among the ruins with no employees in sight. We grabbed some sample cups from the register and dodged napkins and froyo puddles (and other customers) to try some different flavors. The levers are the type that if you pull just a bit too far you make a mess all over your hand especially when trying to squirt a tiny bit in a sample cup. This mess is then added to the greater mess of everyone else attempting this same operation and no-one attempting to clean it up.  The stuff was real overpowering to where instead of tasting like what it was supposed to taste like it was bordering on medicine or like a bad imitation of what it was supposed to be. Like cheesecake doesn't taste like that good cheesecake anyway... And neither does cake batter or banana. Where did the yogurt part go? And how do you screw up cookies and cream exactly? The two that were the best (and most edible) were the Irish mint and the red velvet and that's what we mostly ended up with.  The decor didn't add to our experience. Everything is a mint green but it doesn't come off as retro or even minty but more like dated and hospital-like. Some people really like it but I found it unappetizing.  A surly teenager magically appeared as we approached the register only to disappear again soon after we paid. We sat down at a dirty table and dealt with our choices while the two teens again made an appearance half-mopping-half-attempting-to-clean while chattering back and forth about their dating woes. We finished our yogurt but both strongly considered abandoning the whole affair.  I very well could have walked into Yogurtini at the worst possible time on the worst possible day with all the factors stacked against them but I won't be returning to find out if this was the case.
pos	It's a beautiful day.  Clear sky and around 65 degrees in the late morning!  What to do?  My little guy had been riding his bike without training wheels.  Woo-hoo!  Is he ready to go on a dirt trail?  We're gearing him up to go mountain biking up North.  Hubby suggested Riparian Preserve.  It was an excellent choice.    \"This is awesome!\"  my little one exclaimed as he bounced up and down on the trail.  Then he'll just stop right in front of me without warning.  Five year olds get distracted so easily.  \"Is that a wasp?  Look at that hover fly!  What kind of ant is that?  What kind of beetles live here!\"  asks my little future entomologist.   We'll be taking some tours and classes the Riparian offers soon!  My little one did bite the dust several times due to some excessively gravelly paths.  He learned to either walk his bike over or slow down a bit.  Such a sport!  \"Let's come back here again.  That was fun!\"  It was fun for us too!  We're so lucky we live not far from here.  It is a very well maintained park.  As it gets hotter we would walk and feed the ducks in the morning and spend the rest of the time in the Regional Library.  I highly recommend you check this place out.
neg	The 3 employees were so busy talking to each other they couldn't remember what we ordered kept having to ask and still didn't get it right.  In the midst of the three employees continuing in their personal chaos my husband finally said \"ok time out! I'm the customer.  Make our sandwiches and then take care of your issues.\". They stopped for a split second all three looked at us then they actually IGNORED us finished their conversation then finished our sandwiches.  We were the only ones in there and we really were shocked!  Good thing I like avacado because it ended up on my sandwich & I didn't order it and after telling the girl she said \"I thought you said...\". Still had the order wrong!  Whew!
pos	The Thai menu is totally amazing!  I had the Panang; and the coconut curry was to die for.  I have been mistakenly driving past this wonderful place for a year.  Do yourself a favor try Na Rai you will be so pleased  you did.  They have a lunch menu as well.
neg	This place was the worst place to EVER live! I lived here from Aug 2010 to may 2011 i was always in the office see when the grates would be fixed?? the office always gave me the run around very rude. You would think after the gun shoots assaults and car break ins that they would fix the gates but nope and to this day they still aren't fixed. When we moved in they said they would be fixed in a week and they lied.  Also the gym is huge but NONE of the equipment works! living here was SO gross! nothing worked our neighbors are Mexican thugs doing drug cat calling at anything that walks it was gross. I hated living here!    But the worst part was a few weeks ago we get a call from collections saying we owe Scottsdale Springs $300 bucks over 10 months after moving out! I called them up like wtf and they were SO rude said too bad pay it or your credit score will hurt we even gave a fowarding address and we NEVER got a letter in the mail about any damages. They claim we never gave them a forwarding address which is bull.   I really hope people read these reviews i would hate to see anyone else scammed by this god awful company!
pos	Tiffany @ the chanel counter.  Tana in the lingerie department.   these are my go-to girls for everything. i bring all of my purchases to them bc they are THAT much better than everyone else. except shoes because the shoe people know how to work that confusing back shoe room.   but everything else: make up accessories clothes....all to one of these girls. i recommend you only work with them as well :)
neg	After several hundred professional massages over the past 20 years I encountered today a first -- a massage therapist who explained that she could not do a massage involving any but mild pressure using her hands. It was an issue of \"protecting the thumbs.\" When I told her I didn't like forearms and elbows she explained that she'd never worked without using her forearms (and I assume her elbows too). After just five minutes when I asked for more pressure she suggested we stop the massage -- that she wasn't the \"therapist for [me].\" She was right. What are they teaching these people these days and why doesn't an excellent outfit like LifeTime Fitness insist on better skills among its massage staff? I won't offer her name but if considering a massage at this establishment I suggest Casie as the only therapist here worth the money.
pos	Yeah it was good. My wife & I went with 2 other foodie couples who are good friends for our monthly \"side dish\" function.  The food was all fantastic.  All 5 of the other people in our group were drinking martinis which they all said were very tasty as well but at $12-$16 per I'm a little put off.  I'm more of a beer guy anyway so I had a couple of craft-brews that are not available everywhere and then settled on a Firestone DBA -- a very very tasty beer -- and had several of those.  Great food great booze club music atmosphere is pretty cool. Outdoor area is excellent. Felt like an idiot when I had to ask where the mens room was only to turn around and find that the huge wall of a door was right behind me and said \"he\" in huge letters on the bottom of the door.  Oh and then (6 or 7 strong beers into the evening) I found that the mirror next to the (only) urinal in the mens room misled me into believing there was a second urinal which I tried unsuccessfully to walk to.  Why is that guy walking directly toward me?  Oh it's me.  In the mirror. Dumbass.  So then (after relieving myself in the actual urinal) I go back out to the table to tell the story about trying to use the urinal in the mens room that doens't exist and somebody else says \"yeah the same fucking thing happened to me too!\" so I don't feel like such a dumbass anymore.  Fun night.
neg	While the menu looked promising have no idea if the food is any good since the hostess failed to even acknowledge our presence when we walked in the door.   We patiently stood there for several minutes while she walked around us to greet and seat two other parties.   Since we were still unable to get her attention  we left and went to Tommy Bahama across the street.
pos	I love this place! I love that it's to-go only (no 3 hour waits like Pizzaria Bianco) and the mozzarella is mouth watering.  Please try the mozzarella tomato basil sandwich. You won't regret it!
neg	When I was growing up we called this the canal. In other parts of town it is still called the canal. In some places people actually fish from it. I think they die right after they eat their catch which is why you don't see them very often. Over the years you periodically hear about dead bodies being found in the canal as well.  Google it.  What is so annoying about this is that Scottsdale is trying to make it seem like this isn't the same heinous canal that's always been there. When I heard about the development around the Scottsdale Waterfront I couldn't figure out what they were talking about. What water? Then I started cracking up when I found out it was the canal.  Come on Scottsdale you can put a dress and lipstick on a pig but it is still a pig. You are not fooling anyone.
pos	Ice Ice Baby... Ice Ice Baby...  All right stop collaborate and listen; Ice Now is here and it's got my attention  Make some drinks - not warm but frosty; And believe me when I say they are not costly Will it ever melt? yo I don't know. Give them a call and they'll show To the extreme I yelp like a sandal; Ice your drinks and get lit like a candle ... Ice ice baby  PS - not sure where the sandal line came in but writing a review in lyric form is a challenge!  This is the best I can do for now...  Need ice for an event?  Call Ice Now! They offer free delivery and their pricing is surprisingly cheap.  And good luck getting the Ice Ice Baby lyrics out of your head... (sorry)!
neg	Service was slow and horrible. Got the steak and eggs.  Steak was half fat. Waiters response was \"Oh!  We have a new supplier\". He didnt take it back and charged us any way. Eggs were cold. Stay away from this place for eating. Bar looked happening.
pos	I love Dr. Scott!! He is the funniest doctor I've ever met and he makes me feel good too! Dr. Scott is always willing to bend over backwards to make sure you are provided the best service and treatment possible. The massage therapists rock too! I will be a lifelong patient of Integrated Chiropractic.
neg	Wow! I can't believe this place gets so many good reviews.  I was hauled here once by co-workers looking for a cheap meal. But how much value does your lunch dollar have when you don't even want to eat the food? Dry and sticky rice; \"white meat chicken\" unidientifiable as such and a sweet glaze that provided the only flavor. Quite frankly it was disgusting and none of the dishes my co-workers had looked any better (though they seemed to be fine with them). I should know to stay away from restaurants that have pictures of their menu items on the wall. The one star is only for the fast and friendly service.
pos	Total wine totally takes a crap on Bev Mo. This store has everything! The employees are also very knowledgeable. The other day we went in and my husband insisted I try red wine instead of sticking to my usual Riesling (I don't like change). So we asked one of the employees and he asked me a few questions then suggested a bottle of Malbec. The Malbec tasted amazing! I was so happy. For those of you who don't know it's not only wine! You can find everything else. Total wine has helped us stock our bar and entertain our guests. Also don't forget to chill your bottles before you leave!
neg	This was a terrible experience.  You can not reach anyone via phone you have to book online which I did and also requested a phone call.  I rcvd no call and had an email in my email confirming a time for cleaning.  I requested a call then and got a reply stating someone would call me in 15 mins.  Still no call.  The cleaners arrived & I had someone let them in.  When I returned they were to clean the bathrooms & they were TERRIBLE TERRIBLE!  The sinks were dirty with tooth paste splatters on sink the inside of the shower had brown marks from some sort of un rinsed product.  I am so unhappy about this.  I have tried to reach them every day since & have not recieved a call back from a voice mail or email.  DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY THEY ARE AWEFUL!
pos	Try the Moroccan Chicken on the low calorie menu.  I was really surprised at how great it is.
neg	So the food at this place is good. Well the sliced turkey sud. But when it came to delivery and internet ordering. Oh my god the incompetence of these people. After and hour 15 mins after the food was suppose to be delivered (the order was 2 turkey subs and garlic cheese bread.) I called and was told that there was no delivery guy and if i can come pick it up that they would knock off 25\%. But the foods not ready yet how long does it take to make 2 subs. So i pick up the goods and damned if i didn't check the bag they didn't give me the 2nd sub. Ugh they never checked the order. If you have online ordering  you need to follow though. So with a second phone call and a second trip to the place and 2 hrs after the original order i FINALLY get home and eat. The only good thing i got was a free lunch.  For that I give them a 1
pos	Wow.  Been there 2 times.  I wanted to revisit to see if it was a fluke and to my pleasant surprise - it wasn't.  I'm from NW Indiana originally.  I know corn.  Indiana sweet corn cannot be beat - well - until I had the corn from America's Taco Shop.  This corn has cotija cheese hot sauce mayo and I swear crack.  There has to be crack in there... I have viscous dreams about that corn and wake up in a cold sweat.  I need that corn... it's just so good.    I don't eat beef and that's the only meat they serve but that won't stop me.  Their vampiro's minus the carne asada bean and cheese burritos chips and salsa quesadilla are all awesome.  They also have delicious horchata.... but that corn....   I know where I'm going tonight.
neg	The staff of this \"establishment\" are some of the rudest most condescending individuals I have ever met in my life. They will not give you ANY money and you will have much better luck at Sunset Clothing Exchange which is right up the street (Plus they actually have friendly staff). The people who are buying the clothes should not be buyers; judging from the way that they style themselves they know nothing about fashion whatsoever. Everyone who has stated that you will not get any money from them for designer items is right... they would much rather have trite \"trendy\" studded vests from Target than a pair of Miu Miu sunglasses.  I was there about a year ago and one of their young female employees was laughing snarking and making faces at me. I had no idea who she was. It got to the point where my friend actually pulled her aside and said something. Today their manager called me something that I can't even print on here. I had never seen him in my life either. I have never done anything to these people except for sell my clothes to them.  Avoid this place at all cost they should change the name to Juggalo Exchange.
pos	Expect no com TAM-foolery here....this joint is serious about their broken rice business!   Endless options of different broken rice (aka com tam= deliciousness)  dishes which typically include shredded pork and whatever type of meat flavors your fancy all within your $6-10 wallet budget! Service is prompt and efficient menu is ez to follow focus your energy on the broken rice dishes; thats what theyre known for.   I highly recommend the shredded pork + pork chop + steamed egg combo that comes with a light pork broth on the side. The portion is HUGE and each component of the dish is so flavorful and unique bringing together a fantastic symphony for your palate. My personal favorite is the steamed egg; there's just something about the soft and moist texture that compliments the broken rice. Go easy on the fish sauce (ngoc mam) they give you on the side (try adding Sriracha to the sauce to add some spice in your life) the dish is by far no means lacking in flavor/sodium. All at a pansy $5.99 I could really eat this all day...everyday!
neg	Well...no worries for the continued bad service...awful prices...average inventory....and just overall bad experience....because the store closes forever this weekend. I have never cared for the place....so I definitely won't miss it. However if your looking for some decent electronic gear at 60-80\% off....then this is your weekend to go. Eat Drink and be Merry my Friends
pos	Woo Hoo!  Little Caesars opens in Fountain Hills!  Yummy pizza.
neg	I have been to a buffet like this before but I will never go to this particular one again.   The food all looked fresh as we went through the food line selecting our favorites and stacking our bowl to the sky. We selected our sauces and turned it over to the grill.   The cook doused our dishes with water quickly cooked the ingredients and returned them in a new bowl.   There is a selection of crispy wonton bits rice and soups for you to add to your tray at no cost. I selected no rice as they were all old and burnt to the pan. I chose the hot and sour soup because it is ma favorite.   Free-range and refills on beverages.   Sat down to eat was not impressed. I could not muster to try a second spoon of the soup as it was absolutely disgusting. The bowl of ingredients were all bland perhaps from the overuse of water at grilling and I am almost certain the tofu had gone bad The slivers of meat that my husband had selected tasted fowl as well. We obviously did not get to far into our meal before leaving. Had we not already paid there would have been several complaints from me and changes in selections.   We could have taken the left overs home but opted to leave them instead.   Suffice to say I do NOT recommend.
pos	Covet is an excellent clothing store. In Arizona there is almost nowhere decent to shop.  unless of course you loooooove Juicy Couture in the event of which you should probably not even bother reading this review because this kind of fashion forward clothing won't appeal to you.   Acne Jeans? check. Endovenera? check. Ksubi? check.  Nike? check.   Covet starts off with an excellent men's shoe section  continues with an excellent men's clothing selection  and finishes off with excellent women's wear.   It really is a shame if you haven't been to Covet yet. Do yourself a  serious favor and support a small business at the same time.
neg	Seriously?! With grocery stores like Fresh & Easy Trader Joe's and even Safeway around here I wouldn't go to Whole Foods regularly for ANYTHING unless I was a bajillionaire. 1. It's wayyyy overpriced. I'm not sure if there's a Central Market around here as haven't seen one yet but even that is better than this in terms of price!   We got a few items here specialty items in bulk foods for example. The wine and beer bar is cool but unlike the Whole Foods in Austin Tx which was the epitome of awesome (2) one can't walk around with beverage in hand here. Too bad the rules are so stringent about that because if I were shopping with a glass of wine maybe I wouldn't notice the horrendous prices quite so much.  My 3rd complaint is that when we ordered coffees from the coffee stand there my mocha and my boyfriend's latte tasted like motor oil after taking forever to be made and the girl saw me swipe my card but THEN told me she \"didn't have a register person\" and I wasn't able to cancel the transaction....so then we had to go back through the main grocery line again. Grrr.  I left unsatisfied uncaffeinated and feeling like I had just wasted ten bucks on coffee that we ended up pouring out.   They get one star for having a wine/beer bar at all but then I have to take that star away because the bar tender said they sold the most beer and wine of any Whole Foods in existence (I call bs - the one in Austin is twelve times busier and people can shop with their beverage of choice and they have a bunch of restaurants there too so it's truly an experience - it dazzles). This leaves one star for the supply of bulk and specialty items they carry. We went to Trader Joe's after got twice as much stuff and spent half as much money. Sayin'.
pos	Love love love! Service is always fabulous and every dish has been perfect. The local cheese plate and AZ wine selections are amazing. I think between the 5 of us we have had everything on the menu and it was all delicious. This is my fave place in the country right now. Can't wait to go back over the holidays!
neg	I went in once looking for Canidae.  Which according to their website bold print they carry but not the fine print.  They don't carry it in all of their stores.  My dog has food allergies so I'm cautious about changing her food quickly but since it was about 7 pm and I was pretty much out of food on this day I figured some food would be better than no food.    During my visit I learned many things.  Apparently Canidae is a inferior brand and ripped off its ingredients and packaging from Innova.  Innova is a far far superior dog food.  Innova is awesome Canidae is for chumps.  Innova is also more expensive and a smaller bag.  Nothing I couldn't afford but annoying none the less. Not wanting to create dog food controversy I bought a bag of the morally superior Innova.  But when I checked out I was asked about four times whether I realized I was buying nibbles instead of bits.  \"You know you have the nibbles. Are you sure you want nibbles?  We have bits if your dog prefers bits\".  She's a 70-lb lab that will eat anything except for vegetables.  I mentioned that the nibbles were fine.  \"Are you sure you want nibbles?  We have bits if you want bits\"?  Dude just ring up the freaking food and get me the hell out of here.  As expected my dog ate the nibbles.  She felt superior for the month supply of Innova that she ate.  Then she went back to the ghetto and ate her  inferior Canidae.
pos	This place pushes out some delicious food Red chile burro with rice and beans is better than any I've had and their Nachos are soooo freaking cheesey and good you'll want to order both for one sitting. Unfortunately only outside seating but cool art work on the building to enjoy while eating and don't be discouraged by there greedy practice of charging for extra hot sauce. But of all things to remember make sure you bring cash the place can't afford a card processing machine which is a good thing other wise I'd be there too often and a fat face looks weird on me
neg	I was very disappointed in my encounter with them today.  I have been going there for years and thought they have done a good job.  Today I picked up my Tori Burch purse that I brought in to have a shoulder strap repaired.  The thread they used for the repair was a light cream color.  The purse and the stitching is a mustard yellow color.  It looks terrible!!!  They tried putting some cream colored shoe polish on the tread no improvement.  Now the thread just looked dirty.  I told them that I was not at all happy with the repair.  They just kept saying in thick accent.  \"It's good I fixed it good\".  They would not refund the amount I prepaid  (prepay only store) or redo it with the correct color thread.  Just kept saying.  \"I fixed it good\".  Looks like I'll be finding a new shoe repair place.
pos	My husband and I have been going here for a few years now. It is one of our favorite places. Really low key affordable amazing food! Between the 2 of us our bill is never more than $10 and we are always stuffed! I love how casual it is and the humus cannot be beat!
neg	pretentious and bad service - attendants are totally clueless (though I feel for them if management makes them wear the costumes they wear). overpriced fashion brands.  if you want to spend $200 on a flannel there are MUCH better options out there.  run in and glance at the sale rack otherwise avoid this place like the plague.
pos	I came here after receiving a free pizza at a Yelp event.  Upper Crust had some of the best food at the event so I couldn't wait to have dinner at the restaurant.    My friend and I came here on a Wednesday and were pleasantly surprised it was 1/2 off a bottle of wine day.  I can't remember exactly which wine we ordered but it was a Shiraz and it was good.  We shared a happy hour appetizer of mild wings and a large pepperoni pizza with basil.  It was all so delicious!    I also came here a different day with my boyfriend and we shared the meatballs with cheese on top and a large pizza with pepperoni sausage and basil.  Again it was very tasty!     Everyone was very friendly and prompt.  I will be back to Upper Crust!
neg	I play squash racquet's a sport favored by the east coast \"elites\" from them Ivy League schools those snooty Britishers and the Pakistani leisure class:)   Why they let me play I'll never know:)  Last evening we had a little tourney in which a group of us from the Village traveled to the outer reaches of Tempe to play a group from Lifetime Fitness:)  It was a jolly good show ever so much fun and our Village group gave the Lifetime group a bit of a \"Rodgering\":)  So it was with happy hearts and high spirits that we headed down the street to the post tourney repast at Skip & Jan's...let me start by saying that the Lifetime group picked this place and it's almost like they knew they were going to lose and wanted to select a venue that would be the grimiest greasiest grubbiest grossest spot to try to eat...they succeeded:)  Where to start...I know...the parking lot:)  When we arrived the total Kelly Blue Book value of the 50-60 cars in the parking lot was about $832...we raised that by several orders of magnitude just by driving in...this parking lot hasn't seen a lot of traffic from the Mercedes/BMW/Lexus/Jaguar crowd (and may never again:)  After I safely parked a block or 2 away I went inside and took in the look and feel of S&J...crappy old wood paneling...tables and chairs from a circa 1955 high school cafeteria...an intriguing mix of flat panel TV's regular TV's and OTB results screens (yeah you can bet the ponies here...the sport of Kings in a slightly less than \"regal\" atmosphere:)  They must have 20-25 pool tables...faded felt...and a whole bunch of people playing pool (and frankly looking like they weren't enjoying themselves...extremely tight and serious expressions on the faces of the people playing and watching...aren't games supposed to be fun? :-)...I suspect there was gambling going on:)  The smell in S&J can only be described as \"extreme humanity\"...the place smelled like it has seen a century's worth of spilled beer cigarette smoke BO vomit urine spoiled food and every other aroma that humans create for themselves...remarkable given the fact that this place can't have been here for more than a few years...how did they do that so quickly? :-)  S&J has menus they have some sort of kitchen they have Jagermeister on \"tap\" they have a bunch of beers on tap and they had a buffet (or \"boofay\" for my friend Ryan C) set up for our group.  It was supposed to be a Taco Bar:)  S&J provided a table full of taco \"fixin's\"...the centerpiece of which was the taco meat hot tray...Holy Crap was that disgusting! :-(  They told us it was ground beef but I know my beef and I don't think this was it...this was ground \"creature\"...possibly some sort of unfortunate non-distinct animal which happened to be near the kitchen when duty called.  I kid of course...as far as I know this was indeed \"beef\"...just not very good \"beef\":(  The hot tray holding the \"meat\" looked like a relief map of the Hawaiian Islands...small mountains of \"meat\" rising out of the ocean of brown/orange grease that was the real body of the dish:(  But I was starving (a banana for breakfast and nothing else) so I tried to make a taco.  I decided to forgo the slotted spoon that everyone was trying to use to fish some meat out of the soupy brine and use some tongs instead...my idea was to try to squeeze as much grease out of the concoction as possible...I was sort of successful but in doing so I probably squeezed any flavor out as well:(  I got back to the table and tried a bite...not good...I added several shakes of Cholla and tried another bite...and that was that:(  One of my buddies had decided to forgo the mystery meat tacos and ordered wings from the menu and offered me one...I'm not sure what the deal with the wings was but the wing I tried seemed to be boiled (no not \"broiled\"...boiled) and then dipped in buffalo sauce...not crispy just wet...all the way through:)  Then they announced that Karaoke was going to start soon...and that was enough for me:(  Adding amateur singing to this tableau would have just been too much:)  Still it's not all bad news...the tires and wheels were still on my car when I was ready to leave...I didn't become immediately ill (although I had kind of a rough morning this morning).  They say shared adversity can make teams grow together so I think I should thank S&J for making the Village Squash group nearly invincible:)
pos	Yes it is bad for you. Yes it is delicious. Great customer service. Clean fast and predictable.
neg	Pop the Soda Shop has closed its doors last month.
pos	I love pita Jungle! Everytime I am in town I make it a point to get here. The food is fresh and healthy(ish). There ice tea comes in a variety of wonderful flavors and is so delicious. I would recommend you eat here especially if you like yummy food with a medditeranean flare.
neg	Come on now let's call a turd a turd on this one.. Waterfront is a stretch its a canal a stinking fucking canal.. leave it to the Scottsdale developers and planners to put a Scottsdalian slant on the turd.. kudo's to them! However with its chain stores and restaurants on one side and pretty lame so far on the other (Southbridge) this has become quite a giant and over priced turd.   Those skinny Scottsdale bitches that hang out at Pink Taco words of advice.. Fucking eat something!
pos	I love the girls there. I get my eyebrows done every two weeks and I get my nails done there as often as I can. Recently I just did the gel nails (just the gel polish not like the fake nail stuff) and I LOVE it. I can't tell you how happy I am that I did it. I always just did my toes because I'd always manage to goof up my fingernails in the first hour after I get them done- but with gels you can't do that because after they're put under the UV Light they dry immediately. No goof ups! Plus they don't chip. The lady said they'd last around two weeks. I'm so happy with them. It's been a week and they still look pretty good. :)
neg	Hands down the single worst public mass transit system I have seen ANY PLACE I have ever lived or traveled to (and I am an avid world traveler).  I've been riding this system on and off (I vaccilate between non-Phoenix-metro cities and here a lot) for roughly 10 years and yeah for a few of those years I would also drive a car here and there so I have a sound basis of comparison.   This is a joke compared to other cities in the USA (and abroad) that have equivalent populations. Hell in NYC and LA it's SOOO much easier to get around even though those places are larger and more densely populated. Phoenix is easily 30 years behind every other city-size comparable mass transit system that's out there. Get with the times!  We need: busses that run MORE than once per 1/2 hour (and that's at it's current fastest) busses that are ON TIME (DAILY they are never on time. Always way too early without waiting or way too late without apology) more stops stops that have actual BENCHES or SHADE or POSTED INFORMATION of any kind. I cannot even imagine how travelers get around on this thing nothing is ever posted with any relevant info or signage.  Etc etc etc. But seriously just god awful and a complete joke to anyone who has ever experienced public transport anywhere else.
pos	An oasis of little kid fun in Phoenix we hadn't been in over a year and came for a birthday party.  They're always running a deal so look for one before departing.  One year we did an annual pass.  It was a good deal.  There are also lots of special events that include deals.  One time we met spiderman.  There are lots of rides mostly for shorter kids.  Some have modest height requirement that exclude the very young and some that exclude the tall.  There's a train carousel mini-coaster tea cup ride an up and down parachute ride several rides that go in circles in different vehicles (e.g. planes cars and helicopters and futuristic flying machines) and a bumper boats ride that turns into a splash pad in the summer.  Determining whether the adults need a wrist band or tickets is always a little tricky as adults are needed on some rides but not others and it also depends on the age of the child.  The place has a little bit of a rundown feel but kids don't notice and have loads of fun.  The arcade is really rundown but the ATM is really nice.  There isn't much shade so be prepared.  All of the staff are really nice.  There are usually a few game and art vendors about: ball toss game sand art and/or face painting.  All are a big hit with the kids but also hit up the wallet for a few bucks a piece.  Everyone is a winner at ball toss by the way.
neg	Don't do business at this unethical business. My $25 savings account from 2009 was  recently stolen from $5 a month for \"account inactivity\" fees. They are a bunch of crooks.  It appears you now need to nickle and dime your customers with BS fees in order to stay in business.   Account closed.
pos	Took us a while to find a good Greek restaurant. We have been here many times and have yet to have a bad meal.  Gyro combo this trip. Meat was very flavorful and great texture. Tzatziki sauce is one of the best I've tasted.
neg	If you're looking for a dining experience at Fry's deli area you're better off going to an actual sit down restaurant.  Fry's \"dining style\" food in the deli area is very substandard at the best.
pos	Sushi ken I love you so much I don't even know where to start! It's about time I write a review. This place in my opinion is the best quality for largest portion size in the valley.   Let me just say now that if are one those people  who A. Like California rolls B. like spicy whatever rolls C. Want to go somewhere trendy and have sake bombers then this is NOT the place for you please just don't come and spare me your stupid review just go to Ra or Stingray or somewhere like that. My husband and I eat here a least every couple of weeks I feel like the staff is our family. They are very nice and polite. A lot of families here restaurant is decorated simply.  Nigeri and sashimi are very good. UNI here is amazing! Yellow tail belly is awesome also love the seaweed salad. From the regular menu I love the yellow tail Kama and the cold soba bowl. I also really like that they are open 7 days a week pretty late since most places in AZ close at like 9.
neg	Staff is nice and that's it. They use very cheap tires that only last for a year.
pos	Best BBQ ever.  Go here and thank me later.
neg	Terrible rolls. The Dragon was so so. The California was bland and the Spicy Tuna was cat food. Seriously it  looked like canned cat food and tasted horrible.
pos	There are many places in the valley and its surrounding cities to eat Mexican food; however there is one and only La Canasta.  In the last two years the boyfriend and I have eaten at this restaurant location quite often. For the money you get exactly what you pay for: a decent meal and generous portions.  The chips and salsa are ever-flowing and the salsa is some of the best I've tasted.  The wait staff are generally pleasant attentive and very accommodating. Plus they frequently recall what you had during your previous visits. I recommend you try the Machaca dinner or my boyfriend's favorite dish the number 5 lunch special.  There are multiple locations in the valley but this one beats them all hands down.
neg	The cheesy breadsticks were delicious.  Everything else not so much.
pos	I do a lot of traveling and during a quick trip to Phoenix I was able to get two classes in at their studio. It was very clean and the people were friendly. I did think the studio was excessively hot my second class but everyone else seemed to be ok with it so perhaps it was just me.   I would defiantly return if I were in the area again.
neg	When owners/staff changed we kept hoping for the best.  (The friendly owners/cooks of the previous restaurant were top notch hence the good reviews).  But now alas. . . Lemon chicken that turned out to be pork (and bad at that) wontons in soup that fall apart greasy greasy lo mein and eggrolls it's just not worth it.  Prefer to give locals the business but this is truly awful even after many hopeful tries.  Panda Express it is until someone else does a better job.
pos	Evil Place!!!  That's right.. I walked in there and I couldnt believe it.  The people were nice to me asking me if I needed help and by the end of the day i had a new kitten!  All joking aisde I love this place.  I know you can buy food and other things cheaper at grocery stores but I kinda like a specialty store like Petsmart.  The staff is great and anything you need they are more than willing to help out.  To this day I have purchased two cats here and both are still awesome and amazing.  The last kitten my girlfriend actually picked up and when I went in there to pick up some food they remembered which kitten we got.  Apparently she was among the favorites that was adopted.    You want good service and a great place for your pets.. Petsmart is the best!
neg	My love affair with Pita Jungle is a long one.....perhaps longer than any other restaurant certainly longer than I can remember and at least for the adult portion of my life which is why it pains me to write this review.   For the last 6 months I have ordered takeout one day a week from this location typically on a Friday or Saturday. The ridiculousness that has become my adult life has necessitated a heavy reliance on takeout for my main source of nourishment. Although the food is always spot on at Pita my takeout experience has been anything but.   The prior 3 out of 4 times I went to pick up my food I ended up waiting past the promised time. Now I'm not unreasonable waiting 5 or 10 minutes is not a big deal but each time has been a wait of 25 to 30+ minutes past the pick up time with no apologies or explanations. I was beginning to wonder if they had ever started cooking my food before I got there. The last time I must've looked really irritated because I was offered an obligatory baklava for my wait.   Used to the wait I started showing up 5 to 10 minutes past the promised time just as preventative maintenance. Imagine my surprise when my order was ready as promised thie time. I left with my bag of food and a smile on my face. I get back to my friend's house open the bag and begin to realize just how badly the order has been screwed up. We ordered 4 items 3 of which were wrong. I load one item up and head back to Pita. Making me wait a ridiculous amount of time for my food is one thing but blatantly screwing up my order is too much. As I explain my situation to the takeout girl she goes to get the Manager who proceeds to inform me that I ordered it wrong. As I struggle to keep my cool I inform them that they must be mistaken. One item was ordered with chicken my item was turkey and the other two were salads. Everything came with chicken. The salads were for my vegetarian friends and I'm allergic to chicken. There's no way you're going to convince me I ordered chicken for myself and two vegetarians. Sorry try again. Without too much ado the correct dishes were provided and yet another obligatory baklava was offered. I declined. There is only so much wrong that baklava can right. Don't get me wrong their baklava is amazing but it's not going to make up for them screwing up my order then trying to blame it on me. Oh and did I mention that they gave me a coupon for a free appetizer? Too bad the coupon expires in a few days.   I'm afraid I will be taking my weekly Friday takeout business elsewhere until enough time has passed that maybe just maybe I can find it in my heart to forgive Pita Jungle. In the meantime I suggest you try to get it together down there. In case you missed the count that's 4 out of the last 5 takeouts you missed the mark on including 1 you tried to blame on me. That's shameful.
pos	I love guerrero's!  I worked in Mesa 15 years ago and we did burrito runs here all the time. I'm a huera but my Hispanic pals all rated this place authentic.  It's a husband and wife team that runs it.  The best thing are the beans - incidentally that's how I rate the authenticity of Mexican fare- They are the kind of beans I ate in Nogales during college (at a place I could only locate while intoxicated).  Thinner lighter colored and delicious compared to any I've EVER had this side of the border.  I live in PV now- super far - but after this I think I'm gonna have to take a road trip tomorrow to Mesa! Yum!
neg	Have been going to LGO since 2003 and have always enjoyed the cuisine. Several times - either when ordering in the grocery or dining at the Pizzeria - the music has been so headsplitting as to wipe out any ambience or semblance of a welcoming neighborhood restaurant. Last night the demographic in the Pizzeria during the course of our meal ranged from 30-80 years of age. Several pleas to turn the music down just enough to be able to hear the waiter standing next to me were greeted with \"it's just how we do things\" and \"there's no point in asking because they won't turn it down even a little\". The waiter David said many servers consistently relay complaints but that the owner \"really doesn't care\". Hubris is so unappetizing. I think the food is great but because I have no desire to support a business that really doesn't give a crap about its clientele I'll spend my money lavishly elsewhere.
pos	I love the Superstition Mountains! It is the most convenient place to get away from it all. The last time I was there I hiked Siphon Draw up to the Flat Iron. There were a lot of people on the trail but I still felt like I was in the wilderness.  Camping sites fill up fast here so I would recommend checking out the Canyon Lake area as it is close and a pretty drive.
neg	Wow... After eating sushi from across the nation i have to say Scottsdale's Geisha A Go Go has surprised me for an ultimate low. Andrew the manager reassured us that we had something wrong with our taste buds for not tasting how fresh the fish was here. Insulting to assume. Not recommended!!!!
pos	I have never had BBQ in the South Texas or anywhere outside of California (except Bobby Q) but of all the places I've tried Bobby Q is my current favorite BBQ place EVER!  I found this place on Yelp and came here while on a trip to Arizona.  The place was pretty crowded but we only  waited about 15-20 minutes.  We ordered babyback ribs St. Louis ribs corn and mac&cheese.  They also give you DELICIOUS AMAZING CORNBREAD!  Everything was excellent.  The St. Louis ribs were the best ribs I have ever had.  They were extremely tender and had a nice flavorful bark on the  outside with dark grill marks.  Their BBQ sauce was equally awesome and the kind I like -- a bit more on the sweeter side less on the vinegary side.  The babyback ribs were also tasty but not as flavorful (and less meat of course) than the St. Louis ones.  The sides were good but more forgettable due to the sheer perfection of their ribs.  I don't know if I will ever be in Phoenix again but this place is a must-return if I ever am.  Oh and at the end of the meal they gave us complimentary piping hot FRESH cinnamon donuts!  That double-won me over.  I want Bobby Q right now.
neg	We were so disappointed!  We were on vacation in Scottsdale and wanted to try a Brazilian restaurant.  It was nothing like the one we have had home.  Actually it was completely worse than all three Brazilian steakhouses we have close to home.  I tried about 12 different meats and I think there were only 2 out of the 12 that were tender.  The rest were over cooked or hard as a rock.  We really wanted to love this place as I kept trying more and more of the meats as they came around hoping the next one would be better.  Besides being hard the meats didn't have much flavor.  The salad bar was okay and I don't know that I would even pay the cheaper price to just eat from their salad bar.  This is sad that I have to say the highlight or our meal was the fresh bread and salami slice you get at the salad bar.  :(
pos	I am sad that Lucky's is so far from where we live.  I worked near Lucky's last year and just happened to walk in for lunch.  My lunch was so good I took a huge meat lovers pie home which was so good my husband proposed all over again!  The employees were so friendly and explained that their pizza might take a little longer than normal but they want to make sure it's right.  I loved everything about my visit there and was able to stop in a couple more times throughout the year.  It's about an hour drive from where I live but the more I think about it I think we're going to have to go get some more Lucky's pizza.  Great neighborhood pizza place!
neg	beware of the hidden  65 cent surcharge per person for tea even if you don't drink tea?  really.  The crazy thing is i'm sure no one even notices the extra cost because who checks the bill?  When I mentioned it to the cashier she was stuttering and stammering and started to back pedal and said  \"oh is this your 1st time?  we can remove it from the bill\"  I said forget it keep it.  i usually tip 20-30\% but i'll just let them keep their meager 65 per charge.    yeah really worth losing a customer for?  my 4 year old daughter even gets the gratuitus tea party charge and she only drinks water.  gone are the $2.15 per item flat rate (can you say bait and switch?)  $2.35 PER so now they're no different from the rest of the dim sum places.  as sneaky as C-FOO trying to strong arm the 15\% gratuity (which failed miserably and lost us and about 100 of our friends as customers)  so in a down economy you're supposed to raise your prices and sneak in stealthy surcharges?  it's the chinese way i guess  back to china king for us.  sorry china king for being disloyal with having a brief and sordid affair with the palace.  will you forgive us? haha
pos	Rarely crowded. 4 tables indoors many more outdoors. Wifi is usually fast. Only downside is that it's next to a gas station so the visuals out the window aren't exactly spectacular. But if you care about that why are you in Scottsdale?
neg	We had looked to buy a unit here & looked at several units then decided to rent for a while first.  We've been here almost a year & loved it at first but have had horrible noise problems for about 8 months & management won't do a thing about it.   The walls here are paper-thin & we our neighbor plays her music loudly at 3am almost every night.  It's so loud that we had to move our bed to the other side of the room and run a humidifier all night just to try to block the noise but that doesn't work.  We've called security several times but it never seems to help.  The ceilings are also very thin & you can easiy hear any walking above you.   Aesthetically this place looks great.  The gym is great too but the construction is horrible.
pos	Attended the Pink charity event at the Shade bar.  Great time and the scene was fantastic.  Need to highlight the job that Jason and Halley do with VIP tables.  I've worked with both of them twice now and the experience is always top notch.  Always ensure that the experience is better than expected.
neg	I live down the street from Casey Moore's. I have been here a total of three times. The first time a group of us just ordered drinks and the margaritas my friend and I ordered were so terrible that we sent them back. The second time I went with my husband and ordered a crab salad sandwich. Again it was so awful I had to send it back. I am not a picky eater nor have I been known to complain about food or service when dining out. There has only been one other restaurant I have ever been to where I sent food back. So this place was already two for two. Alas my husband begged me to go back once more. He was craving oysters and since this is an oyster house I figured it wouldn't hurt to give them one more shot. It was last Thursday evening and the place was hoppin'. This time the food was decent. Not good but decent enough where I may have given Casey Moore's a fourth chance had I been impressed with the service. But the service was HORRIBLE. Our waitress got us our drinks and didn't come back to take our orders for another 20 minutes. We sat there awkwardly waiting for her to stop by and though she passed us quickly several times she never even acknowledged us with a simple \"I'll be back with your orders.\" When she did arrive 20 minutes later she asked if we were ready to order without even an apology. I am not kidding you when I say she acted like she wanted nothing to do with us. She was very monotone and never smiled with us. I would like to pass this off as her having a bad night but when she went to her other tables (all full of men with drinks) she suddenly lit up laughed and had a blast with them. It was so awkward to the point that my husband asked if maybe we knew her and had upset her in some way in the past. But no. This was our first time meeting her. We were pleasant customers who didn't complain about the mediocre food or slow service. We were polite and left a good tip. We pride ourselves on being fun engaging and polite with our servers since we go out often. But let me tell you right now what makes me the most angry. We live so damn close to this place and would have loved to be regulars... It is such a shame that Casey Moore's has now given us three good reasons to never come back. And I can't find any information on their website of how to contact the manager about this so I am left to rant here on Yelp completely unsatisfied. Sigh...
pos	I can't add much to what has already been said....BUT I'll try haha!  Um don't come here without a map or some sort of gps device (NOTE: some spots in the mountain do not get good reception so a map on your phone may not always fully come in). It is VERY easy to get lost!  There are many trails I look forward to getting to know them better. So far all I have really done is Mormon Trail and the Hidden Valley Loop.....Fat Man's pass is probably my most favorite spot...OH! AND there are some really cool rock formations on the way there (including a natural tunnel) look for the rock that looks like a big mushroom!  This is a good area to do a hike in the dark....but don't do it until you've done the trail a couple times in daylight. You can see what seems like the whole valley from up there! If you do the night hike make sure the moon is full.....you can actually see pretty well with that and the city lights. Plus it's GORGEOUS! (if you did mormon trail at night you could start about an hour before sunset then head back as the sun goes down)  Don't forget water it is a moderate level hike.....and flashlights would be a good idea too just in case :)
neg	I am a huge tea drinker so when I found out about Teavana I was excited.  I entered the store and an employee asked if I cared to try some tea. After sampling several different blends I chose three to purchase.  The employee asked if I wanted to get a large canister for a dollar more than the one I had picked. Not realizing this store sells tea by the ounce rather than per canister I said \"sure.\" He chatted as he filled the containers never mentioning the price and once done took my debit card and rang me up. I didn't pay attention to the cost and when I looked at the receipt when I got home my heart nearly stopped. I spent $350 on tea. I returned it and they didn't give me too much trouble. Now I always check the total before handing my card over and I won't go back. I feel like they totally swindled me.
pos	When Hoa called and said we were having a reunion of former branch employees at a Chinese buffet I wasn't at all apprehensive. My normal concerns with such eateries--will the food be maintained at a proper food-safe temperature is this seafood fresh how long has the sushi been sitting out will I be able to make it home before my intestines rupture--dissipated because Hoa knows good Asian cuisine. She is of course born to Vietnam and world traveled.   Let's start with my happiest aspect about HKGB: the sushi. No it's not the best sushi in the Valley but they make it fresh for you on site. You can stand there and watch it being make grab a soup or something else to munch on or just sit at your table and chat awhile. Afterwards you can head back for more sushi or veer over to the more traditional offerings of a Chinese buffet: sweet and sour chicken fried rice crab legs.   Now let's review the not-so-shiny aspect: the price. Yes it seems a little steep that we paid about $25 per person with tip (and I made only two rounds) but when you factor in the 2 hours we spent there grazing catching up grazing passing Lisette's daughter around grazing and making plans to keep in touch it's really not such an outrageous amount to pay.   If you find yourself in this part of town craving Chinese and are wicked crazy hungry give HKGB a shot.
neg	We came here for dinner for me and reverse happy hour for my wife we ordered our appetizers and after finishing them and looking over the menu for a few minutes we were ready to jump into the overpriced entrees. We were then informed that we couldn't order dinner. Maybe when they see someone coming in and telling them they are...here for dinner...they might give them a heads up that the kitchen Is closing so we can order our meals and not be told five minutes after it did close..fourth time we've given this place a and got crappy service. Bartender got a buck tip and we had to go find another restaurant for dinner Needless to say we won't be giving them another chance. Not good Gordon B. Not good.
pos	LOVE Chino Bandido.  The snickerdoodle cookie they give you with your meal is heaven.  Well all of the food might actually be heaven but usually by the time I get to the snickerdoodle I could die happy on the spot.
neg	Disclaimer: I am a Thai person and a Thai food connoisseur.   This is supremely average Thai food and overpriced as heck to take advantage of White People. Sorry to be blunt but that's all it is. $18 dishes that are $8 at a real Thai restaurant. The spring rolls were very bland and came with only a tiny bit of sauce for dipping. They should also include on the table a selection of fish sauces and spices to add to your meals and appetizers. They dont have.  If you like spicy skip it for sure. Again this is what we would call Tourist Thai back in Thailand.   Tiny servings.  The good. Friendly wait staff.  If authentic Thai is what you're looking for try any of these: Palees Crown Tum Nak Thai or Royal Thai Grill.
pos	I pride myself on being 'that girl' that tries out every restaurant I come across. It's practically a hobby for me. For YEARS I kept saying \"I want to go to Cowboy Ciao\" but we never made it. Then thankfully the hubs' best friend had a big birthday dinner there so we just HAD to go. (Thank you hubs' best friend!)  I have to say that the service was incredible and the menu was almost overwhelming. There were SO many interesting choices but I had to stick to the tried and true chopped salad - everyone and their mother has told me about this salad and I wasn't about to miss out. The hubs ordered the Tenderbelly Pork Shank.   The chopped salad has earned its reputation. That thing is de-freaking-licious. The Pork Shank dish was fabulous as well but I couldn't get over how great the salad was! AND the server always came over to make sure that my wine glass was never empty. Seriously can it get any better?  For dessert we ordered the spumoni- I have had better (no offense) but I'm not sure anything served after that salad would have made me happy :)  I'm very glad we finally made it to Cowboy Ciao and I look forward to going back - SOON!
neg	Look it upsets me that you have to give even one star.   I can read the other reviews and I have been here more than a few times but tonight it was just beyond a bad dinner.   Yes we were the table of 7 people at about 8pm yes we were group at the high top tables that were pushed together. You would have to remember us because we were the table that had 1/2 of a waiter. It was so nice of you to take the time to take our order and then let the waiter go home because he had been there since lunch.   You know what sucks more than working 2 shifts? How about being the last table for the guy who worked 2 shifts it was so nice of the manager to let him leave but hey how about taking the time to have someone FINISH the open orders?   Simply the food was not good and you are over priced.  But the worst part is that your staff is just not good at their job THEY DONT CARE and that is a result of MANAGEMENT not caring.
pos	The facility is a bit dated but the service is great.  Dr. Rios is patient and thorough and his staff are friendly and efficient.  Dr. Rios gave me several different alternative contacts to try in order to make sure that I was getting the right fit for me - it made a big difference.  Who knew that they make bi-focal contacts now?  They're great.
neg	One star would be giving it a holiday gift!  For me Copper Star Coffee Shop has been a place where consistency and pride is taken in their food and presentation. Unfortunately Circle H BBQ is nothing like the prior statement.  My first visit to Circle H BBQ centered on ordering a half slap of ribs. They were extremely over-cooked.  There was more charcoal on the top back and ends that was just not editable.  Once you scraped away the charcoal on the tops ends and the center ribs there was one that was eatable.   The company offered me a second chance to try their food by giving me a complementary full slap.  Nothing had improved. They say they smoke the ribs but there was no odor to that effect. In face the ribs I ordered the second time spend over 20 minutes on the grill after the order was placed. Btw...the waitress at the front counter couldn't even tell be the type of rub on the ribs and the type of cut they were. When I asked if they were smoked (cooked) daily she said some are if you get here early - others were from the refrigerator from last night. The so called \"dry-rub\" seasoning was tasteless. The BBQ sauce is major strange!  The bottom line is the ribs were not worth the cost they were charging. ($14/Half for 6 bones and $26/Whole 12-13 bones both with sides) I have high hopes for the brisket but it might be a while untill I try that endeavor.  Overall if they don't change the way they 'burn\" the ribs run run or drive real fast to another place.  The charcoal is not good for you and there is lots of it!  Honey Bears My Mothers or even driving to Famous Dave's is well worth the trip. Sorry to burst your bubble I too had high hops for a centrally located rib place.    I'm still waiting.
pos	Went wed nite wife tells me best gnocchi since Europe were cooked perfectly . I had pollo erbe terrific.   \" wine tasting director\" very good with tasty selections. Will be back OFTEN. Highly recommend. Rich D
neg	This place was just... okay. First I'd like to say that my bridal consultant (don't remember her name - sorry) was really nice and helpful. But to me most of the other saleswomen had \"desperation\" all over their faces (don't know if they work off of commission or if the higher ups are just slave laborers or what but I'm sure some of them would've killed for a sale). I found a few dresses I liked but they were way too high pressure for me to be able to make a solid decision on the spot so I decided to wait on it. I ended up finding a dress I liked better for about 1/3 of the price somewhere else. I notified David's Bridal \"thanks but no thanks\" about 6 months ago. To this day I still get calls to my cell phone asking me to \"come back in and try on the dress\"... they're like the telemarketers of the bridal world! So annoying. Plus their accessories are so expensive and very cookie cutter. I'd go somewhere else unless you're new to this and need some ideas.
pos	Our family have used this Discount Tire for 11 years now.  Amazing service and warranty on tires.  Thank you!
neg	I really wish I had a dagger to stab myself in the face for trying to eating here. Absolutely the WORST PLACE in the entire valley. I would turn around and go ask for my money back but I am to embarrassed to even be seen in the drive through again.   Was on my way home thought I would give it a shot. I ordered random items; chicken taco and onion rings. The taco was like eating out of a horse trough.. It fell apart immediately and I found myself trying to shovel it into my mouth. After about two bites I realized the meat was questionably chicken. The onion rings were so blah I didn't even touch them.   Please do your self a favor.. Dig in the nearest dumpster for lunch then go home and pound a bottle of vegetable oil. It sure beats the hell out of this joint. No joke.
pos	I can't think of a better Thai rest. In PHX. Consistently good food and service.  They have Thai staples like rice paper rolls Tom Ka Gai and Pad Thai as well as more creative items such as Crispy Mango Fish. Average Thai food pricing free parking.  There are a good number of tables so don't let a short line dissuade you.  Like any rest. scope your table before you sit to be sure it suits your mood.  Boisterous din in the main room when busy.
neg	We had read good things about Over Easy and were excited to try it out. We went a few days after Christmas and were horribly disappointed.  When we walked in we were seated by one server. Then a few minutes later another host came up to us and asked why we stole a table and did we not understand how seating works? We were quite confused and offended as we were seated properly and had done nothing wrong.  Then once we ordered we waited over 45 minutes for our food. Finally we asked about it and then it was out within a few minutes. They had completely lost our order.  When our food arrived one dish (the Over Easy -- toasted brioche with spinach & an egg) was absolutely inedible. The brioche was so burnt that we could barely cut it as was the bacon. The fried egg was very undercooked even though we requested it completely cooked through. I was honestly shocked the server brought us the dish without saying anything since it was clearly burnt.  The other 2 dishes (banana & pecan french toast and the Loretta sandwich) were just alright -- certainly nothing to rave about. And the 3 of us ended up splitting these 2 dishes since the other dish was awful. We ended up leaving early because we were all so disappointed. At which point our server asked if we'd like a box for our uneaten burnt brioche. It would have been much more appropriate for her to ask if there was something wrong with it since it was obviously not eaten.  Anyway I'm not sure if we just caught them on a bad day but I would never go back again or recommend Over Easy to anyone else.
pos	The new Harkins Cine Capri one of the first things to open in Tempe Marketplace boasts 16 theatres and offers more than the norm when it comes to movie snacks. Moviegoers can order brownie bites mozzarella sticks and pizza.  The theatre is super spacious and the seats are plush and comfy. And the screen is huge. This is my new favorite movie theatre.
neg	It's a supermarket.  I just go in buy what I need and get out.  It's convenient that there's a wells fargo in there but there's one across the street as well.    To the negative experience..... My sister was speaking to my niece but not in english.  Some caucasian lady walks by and rudely says \"Can't you speak english?\"  WTF?!?  Is this taking SB 1070 in your own hands?  It's like you're trying to make every race hate you even more.  I will run into this arrogance wherever I go.  I'm not done yet.  Keep on reading.... My niece had a dollar in her hand and was pointing at the lottery scratcher machine.  We know you have to be of a certain age to play it.  One of the employees there rushes over and in a loud voice tells me niece she can't play it.  Calm down.  Kids are just innocent and don't need this extra verbal abuse in their lives.  Don't you have something better to do like restock the shelves?  Swear... Racial profiling.
pos	Postinos a spot for high rollin' winos.   You woke up at noon and had breakfast during lunchtime so the next logical step is to have lunch food during dinner time with some wine. This is where postino's comes in.   The menu is full of salads Paninis bruschetta and a few apps. There is a large by the glass wine menu ($8-$14) and hipster cool ambiance.   Service here is great the patio is quite nice with heaters a fire place and even a few patio furniture loungers.  Great for a date hanging with friends and conversation.  We started with the Bella Postino $9 Crustini with a artichoke dip and a hummus. The artichoke dip was great as any fat laden dip would be. The humus was ok but I am a hummus  snob.  For our main we had the Vegetarian Panini ($9.75) It was good and moist with hummus roasted tomatoes olives and an artichoke spread the focaccia bread was well toasted from the Panini press.  We also had the mediterranean  salad 8.75 which is a romaine salad with copious amounts of feta. Pretty good as I do like cheese but maybe not as healthy as one would want from a salad.  For desert we had a crem burle simple not to sweet and well executed a classic.
neg	This may be my worst dining experience ever.  The scenery was beautiful we can't complain about that. The menu was decent there was a good number of selections to choose from. However the prices were definitely high we're just talking tacos & burritos here...  I ordered a taco salad with steak. It was $11.99 for lunch...which I thought was crazy.  When I got the salad it was the cheap iceberg lettuce with a couple tomatoes & a few onions. The steak was DISCUSTING. I wouldn't feed a dog that steak meat. I asked the waiter for some salad dressing he gave me this funny look and said \"most people just use salsa but I guess I can get you some ranch or something\". Great service huh? I asked the waiter about the margarittas and he willingfully told me that the 3 cheapest ones are no good and are too watered down. Nice...so I then asked about the Patron Margaritta (my fav tequilla). The Patron rita was $16!!!   The waiter was extremely unprofessional and even gave us this pitch about how he's only working there until he finds a new \"gig\". The prices were ridiculous! I would NEVER go there again and hope to share my story with many people before they waste their money!!
pos	Soooo this location is even better than the one in Superstition Springs. They also have a play place which is pretty cool. I ordered the deluxe chicken and it was simply amazing. Fantastic service as well. I ordered and set my stuff down and within a couple minutes my food was brought out to me with a smile. Very polite staff and delicious food.... what more could one ask for? I totally wish Chick-fil-A would sell thier Chick-fil-A sauce by the bottle cuz it's sooo good
neg	Completely shady.  Towed our U-haul as we were moving in to our new Apartment Complex.  Completely unethical and total crooks.  AVOID AT ALL COSTS!

neg	OMG! what is the rave about? this place is disgusting! it's dirty and the food is not worth it! i came here with my family and we each order a little bit of everything that is suppose to be good and popular there. unfortunately everything is bad. i walked by the waiters and they were all cursing really loud in vietnamese to each other. the table is icky and it smell like my cooked up oil . ick! go to Pho ao sen instead at least it's clean.
pos	One of my favorite brunch spots.  Not the cheapest but you come here to admire the Arcadia families/couples coming into have brunch.  There is sometimes a wait but it is worth it.  I have a hard time deciding between the lunch salads and breakfast.  I usually cave and get the french toast or ginormous belgian waffle.  Parking is plentiful but it is on a weird corner in the strip mall if you are going look for cork and cleaver.
neg	Horrible service. Twice now I've gone there and they keep messing up my drink. I work for Starbucks!! It's not hard to get a drink right! Believe me. Horrible service. The people that work there All have bad attitude. One lady doesn't even look at you when your ordering your drink. I think that someone needs to go In there and fix it and make it a welcoming Starbucks that it's known for. Ya a few of the employees that work there are absolutely wonderful but when you get that one that is just rude it just makes you not want to go there anymore. I stopped going. They still get my drink wrong when my mom goes to get coffee. Horrible.
pos	Seriously.  I seldom give 5 stars but it deserves at least this much. If it wasn't for the location and the super scary after dinner club scene I would go every.single.day.  Truly one the best BBQ places in greater Phoenix.  My mouth is watering as I'm thinking about the Hog Heaven special.  In fact my puppies mouths are watering too.  Decent prices giant selection.  One of those places where the early cowboys of the SW would appreciate.     If you are a cracker family I suggest going super early like super early bird special early  like when the snow birds come out for the senior special early because after dusk the whole place transforms into a pulsating super loud super dicey Mexican Dance Club and the blue hairs are sure to have a coronary attack after indulging in such a  lipid laden meal as they attempt to make their way out of the Club.     Ah the sacrifice for decent BBQ....
neg	This address is for the one next to Panda Express not the one in Walmart.  This place sucks and it doesnt even come close to any other McDonalds. How in the world can you have so many employees working and have a line of people waiting for their food? It's like there is retarded people working there and they all have special needs. This one guys was just waiting for a happy meal and had been waiting for 10 minutes before I even got there. It them about 15 minutes for them to give me my food. One mexican kid that was working was to busy flirting with this girl in front of everyone while her father was asking why the food was taking so long to make.   The dining area was dirty after I got my food and sat down. They should fire the manager and everyone that works there. They take no pride in working there and its sad to see this. It shouldnt matter what they are being paid to be there its still a job and they ARE being paid to be there.   I will NOT be returning to this place.......
pos	I live in two cities in two different states and travel back and forth each month.  I tend to use services where I find them and haven't really found a  really great barbershop in the last three years.  While I was in Anthem this week I decided to give Vs Barbershop at Happy Valley Road a try.  I rarely use chains and prefer a more intimate and personal hair stylist but I was pleasantly surprised this time.  I was able to make my appoinmtnt online and choose the services I wanted to have with the haircut--very efficient.  I didn't know any of the barbers so I just let the shop (?software) choose one.  I was treated to a superb haircut a very satisfying shave and a facial mask and massage.  My barber Manuel was precise experienced and he went about his business with style. I cannot imagine how many hot towels he used but I would not want their laundry bill. Finally Manuel washed my hair AFTER the cut which makes all the difference for the rest of the day. The overall experience was excellent and I am sure to return the next time I am in town.  Yes the package was pricey but the haircut was standard price for this type of service. This is no Supercuts or Hair Salon--trust me on that.  If you are looking for that old style Barber experience with more than just a clipped head please give Vs a try.  By the way it is just behind Paradise Bakery in The Shops at Norterra.
neg	Just a quick update - this KFC shut down just a few weeks ago.   There still might be someone in line tho...
pos	Awesome place!! EXCELLENT food/apps(try the bleu cheese figs)! Ask for Dizzy Dre he's AWSOME and listens to your likes and customizes drinks for you!! Very patient with women!! ;)
neg	I have literally never seen this place open and I live two blocks away.
pos	Do not bother going anywhere else. This is the place to go for laser. No contracts easy to get appointments very reasonable. The staff is fantastic every one of them. I usually go to Kristen but all others are as equally friendly and competent. Location is very convenient also. I have looked and I have received many groupon and living social offers from other places but I never bothered. This is the one.
neg	AMC Theaters has the distinct disadvantage in Phoenix at operating in a town with a high-quality local provider of entertainment (Harkins) and they really pale in comparison. Tonight we went to the AMC 24 at Arizona Center which is literally right near our house but we've been there only two or three times in as many years. Why? Because AMC doesn't offer a senior discount any longer.  For AMC Management -- Did you know that there is a huge population of older people living in condos in the downtown Phoenix location who go to moves three and four times a week? I think it is absolutely ridiculous that I could go to a Harkins and see a movie for $12-13 for two but when it's an AMC Theater it's $20. Do they think they are so special that they warrant this extra \"tax\"?  The theater is generally clean and nice but the prices on sodas and popcorn are too high combined with the fact that they don't offer the discount to seniors. AMC please just fold up your tent and go away. We don't need you here.
pos	I realize L&L is a chain but I love their food. My favorites are the Loco Moco and the BBQ Chicken. I also enjoy their haupia-filled donuts. The family that runs this place is very friendly and do a great job in making sure you will enjoy your meal. Go there.
neg	Bitzee Mama's isn't my mama! My mama wouldn't have kept her hungry son waiting forever for his lunch. She wouldn't have let my go thirsty with no refills. She does make a good bowl of salsa so that makes it alright right?   Took my real mama there for lunch.. I ordered the taco salad and ma ordered the cheese enchilada plate.. also a bowl or red chile. Taco salad was alright except the taco shell was so mushy from water it literally fell apart when I picked it up.. glad I wasn't eating the shell. She's old school.. makes a darn good cheese enchilada and refried beans. Struck out again with the red chile.. I swear can no one except La Canasta make red chile? While the meat was tender and the sauce was smooth it had a weird orange color to it and the meat tasted well wasn't any beef Ive ever had.   On the way to the counter to pay my bill I noticed that almost everyone was eating chimichanga's.. well then looks like I ordered the wrong thing! Place is also uber cheap.   Be careful what you order and mama will be just fine.
pos	This is my favorite pho joint in all of Arizona. I have been to about 17 from flagstaff to mesa to central and Tucson! The owners are so welcoming and very proud of their business and it shows! The place is always clean and the bathrooms are immaculate! I always order pho Tai and water.. But I've had both their egg rolls and spring rolls both excellent! I love the broth! It's true pho broth.. It's not the beef bullion cubes other place use and you can defiantly taste the difference! The sprouts are the cleanest I have ever seen! I love this pho place ...  try the greatest pho in Arizona!
neg	Closed... GONE UNDER OUTTA HERE.. See ya later bye bye..
pos	I have been visiting Mrs. White's going on 30 years but after looking up the phone number this afternoon to verify if they were open and still had fried chicken my wife started reading some of the reviews following a recent Food Network recommendation - I almost got cold feet.  Good thing I didn't. The food is as awesome as ever. The service is much as it has always been. Be forewarned trendy restaurant goers who glom onto TV reviews Mrs. White's is not trendy; there are no bubbly fresh blonde girls waiting to seat you. The service is matter of fact no goofing around you must get to the business of ordering and pretend you know what you are doing - this is the way it has always been at Mrs. White's. If you are looking for others to pamper you this is not the place for that. Mrs. White's is where you go to pamper your indulgence for perfect soul food. If you want Scottsdale ambiance again this joint won't work for you.  When you go be prepared that not all dishes may be on the menu during your visit. There are no corporate owned semi-trailers that deliver two tons of food every other day. This is a small and very cramped operation that makes homemade food for those who know how to appreciate it. In these days of flash frozen prepared dishes that are uniform from visit to visit at chain restaurants this food is made in a tiny hot kitchen. If they run out of your favorite dish that has been cooking for hours prior to your arrival there is no way they can whip up another pot of green beans and potatoes in 20 minutes.   I often call ahead to verify if they have what I want because years ago it was not uncommon that by 12:30 they would be out of half of everything on the menu which was OK because if forced me to try new things Back then Mrs. White's was open Monday through Friday from 11:00 till 3:00 but I'd swear you'd be lucky to get anything after 1:00 - and that was perfectly fine as you knew they were doing all they could with their limited space to do their best for us customers. I'd just come back on another day.   To say I have the utmost respect for the White family would be an understatement today I was afraid I might have to lose that based on those poor reviews below. I do not believe those reviews are an accurate representation of The Golden Rule Cafe. They are the distortions and disappointments of people who have skewed expectations. Funky little hole-in-the-wall family-run operations that attract a loyal customer base may not be the place for everyone but if you understand that wonderful stuff doesn't always come wrapped in a sterile designer package then you might get along with Mrs. White's.  I love this place and hope I always will.
neg	It was family day (the ex and I like to see our son smile) and we were starving... after driving around for a while we pulled up to Arriba's and said \"what the hell...\"  That's also what we said when some of the food came as in \"what the hell is this??\"  So positive first.  The server was pretty quick and he gave refills without being asked.  Chips and salsa were good.  Chips were warm and salsa had a nice (suprising) kick.  Kick... do I sound like an old lady?   Morgan and I ordered fish tacos and beef tacos respectively so we could swap one for one.  Fish was ok... nothing spectacular... but honestly I would rather pay for one at freakin Del Taco or Rubios.  Not worth it here.  Rice was ok some flavor probably converted rice though.  Beans were... blended?  I dunno about you but I like to see some actual BEANS in my beans!  This stuff was like brown goo... YUMMMMMMMM... :P  The beef taco was just weird.  I swear to God is tasted like gyro meat!  WTF?  I couldn't eat much of it.    Last but not least Dom ordered the White Sands Chimichanga.  That sh*t looked nasty to be honest.  Covered with some gooey white sauce filled with pork.  LOL he said it tasted like hot dog.  Um yikes!  He took about 2 bites and was \"full\".  A.K.A. he didn't like it.  I also had a margarita... it was HUGE and didn't taste very good.  I'd rather have one 1/4 that size that tasted nice.  Oh well.  One star for the chips and salsa.  Like I said the fish taco was okay but every thing was just way over-priced!    Final verdict?  We decided to NEVER go there again.
pos	Best happy hour on this side of town. The bartenders are very friendly and service is always prompt. I've never had a bad drink or a bad meal here. I only go in if Jennifer is working though! The bar has plenty of TVs too.
neg	This was the most HORRIBLE floor cleaning I have ever seen!!!!! We took before and after pictures and cannot tell the difference at all! The guy was not friendly and just wanted our money even though he did not do his job! I would NEVER recommend this company to anyone. We paid $1000 and got $20 worth of service. I mopped the floor the day after the cleaning guy was here and got a lot of the \"staining as he would say\" off easily. I have included a picture that we wrote in the floor with a paper towel after the cleaning....can you read the saying? That is exctaly how we felt after the service. REALLY?!?!?
pos	I have been to Mabel's a few times now and I think it is a pretty stellar place. The food is awesome (try the chicken lollypops and the deviled eggs) and the drinks are strong. The ambiance is nice and cozy and I think it works well for a romantic dinner or a big group of friends. The staff has always been pleasant and accommodating and that goes a long way for me in Snottsdale.   Last night I was wowed by Mabel's. We had a fundraiser for a great friend who has cancer and they not only let us throw it there FOR FREE but generously offered to donate 20\% of the bar tab to the cause. The service was great that night and they earned a fan for life. Thanks Mabel's for being so cool you're a breath of fresh air.
neg	Donuts are really good if they have any when you get there!!!  Went in on a Tuesday morning at 1030 and they only had a total of 10 donuts. Drove out of my way to go there and still ended up at Dunkin Donuts. Very disappointed!!
pos	Great place for Italian food. Very family friendly. Mellow atmosphere with friendly and knowledgeable staff. Never had a bad meal. My favorite is Sirloin Marsala and you can choose any pasta they have to go with it at no charge. Recommend to anyone who enjoys quality Italian for a good price.
neg	I was so looking forward to breakfast here. What a disappointment.  The food is the only thing that rates any stars at all. Good ingredients cannot be completely ruined by incompetent service.  The space is nice but crowded and loud. The counter staff were indifferent. After being waved over to an open register the fellow behind the counter took one order then wandered off leaving the rest of us to get back in line at the other register to order.  You are given a number (or not) and left to find your own table scrounge up your own silverware and wait for your food to be delivered. Except that the napkins are at a completely different station than the silver they were out of forks and most of the tables were completely filthy. I watched a busboy randomly swipe the top of a table sweeping crumbs onto the benches and chairs then leave an empty drink bottle on the table before wandering listlessly off.  Beverages are (apparently) serve yourself although they didn't bother to say that when I ordered. I stood at the counter waiting for iced tea only to turn around and see that I was expected to get it myself.  If they happen to \"run out of numbers\" then they input your name with your order. Nothing irritates me more than to have my name shouted across a restaurant. Better yet the waiters wander from table to table looking for their customers.... \"Lisa? Is there a Lisa here?\" while your food cools. Inexcusable.  The only bright point: the croque madame was tasty. Delicious bread ham and a perfectly fried egg. But the meager smear of bechamel and a thin slice of cheese were underwhelming. However the \"side of fruit\" made me angry: a tiny metal creamer with 1 blackberry a few slices of strawberry and 2 chunks of  green apple. Insulting.  Fast casual order at the counter works well when tables are clean and set and the food delivery is speedy and efficient. Unfortunately this place needs some work in order to make it worth your time.
pos	I never write these things. But I have to say that you will not be disappointed with Paletas Betty. Especially with the weather right now it is a delicious and healthy treat made with seasonal ingredients. I highly recommend the limón amarillo when in season. Delicious frozen lemondade/lemon drop on a stick tossed in a sugar rub. It is for certain served in heaven. That is all.  P.S. check out the hours yo. You know what's up.
neg	May have great food but I'll never know. Ordered delivery and the chef who doesn't speak English couldn't find my apartment complex even when I walked out to the street right next to the 101 far away. He said he was there but couldn't tell me where he was. Talked to him on the phone for ten minutes then hung up on me when I guess he got frustrated and wouldn't answer my calls back. Called to order food for my visiting family and was glad to find this place but that chef is awful. The owner apologized to me profusely and that was a nice gesture but waiting an hour for a guy who hangs up on you and can't find a place looking at the 101 exit is ridiculous. Don't use them for delivery ever call the Breakfast Joynt. Their owner is awesome and delivers to you himself. Plus he actually knows the area. Cannot express my frustration with this restaurant's service. Do not use EVER
pos	I almost wish I hadn't discovered this place because it's so good! Ton's of flavors and every kind of topping you could want (even cake frosting)  So much better than MoJo and to top it off the staff couldn't have been nicer.
neg	I eat a lot of Asian food (of different sorts).  Asian is actually my go-to cuisine since I have a lot of food allergies.  This place deserves a thumbs-down unless you love Americanized Asian.  The food was bland breaded and just not worth any money.  Next time I'm in Phoenix I definitely won't eat here.
pos	Gotta love Sweet Republic.... great philosophy and great icecream and sorbets. I've loved every single flavor I've had there (peanut butter brownie swirl mint chip salted butter caramel mayan chocolate and more). Everything is made from all natural fresh ingredients (virginia peanuts fresh mint leaves etc).   When I really want to splurge I make my own sundae you get to pick two flavors of icecream a sauce and a topping.   If you haven't been to Sweet Republic go! If you're far from Shea & 101 find them at First Fridays downtown farmers markets and more.
neg	Cadillac Ranch looked really awesome from the outside this nice red cadillac out front nice patio outside and an enclosed bar and grill patio on the side. Upon entering it was pretty dead well it was a Monday afternoon after all.  I ordered the Southwestern Country Fried Steak huge plate of food that came with your choice of House Salad or Ceaser Salad. I dove into the mashed potatos which upon their many options of how you want your potatos to taste (garlic cheese horshradish etc) I picked garlic - always go safe at a first time resturaunt! The gravy was very bland I ended up putting more salt on it. The potatos were the only thing salty and flavored on my plate. They had also put diced garlic in the mix not roasted but raw garlic. I love garlic but I can't eat whole cloves (horrible headaches) like some of those awesome people can out there so it was kinda a downer there. The two pieces of country fried steak was actually steak but the very fatty piece of steak that you should never buy cook and serve.  Since I came with friends and family it seemed the only thing they could put flavor in was the deep fried dishes. My mother ordered the Fish and Chips they were slightly on the dark side the fish wasn't fishy but slightly bland the cocktail sauce was the only thing that saved the fish from being totally neglected lol. The fries were really good though! My friend had ordered the same thing I think she wasn't complaining was because she had ordered mamosa's lol.  Service-wise it was slow but don't expect to be waited on asap on a dead Monday.  I think the only thing that tasted good was the Ice Cream Fudge Brownie but that single dish alone won't help this review get to two stars.  All in all eat at the other different eateries at Tempe Marketplace I think Cadillac Ranch would be the last resort place if you can't get in to another popular resturaunt at the time.
pos	This was our first time at Texas BBQ House. They gave us a sample and help us with our order. The brisket was fantastic. I got the moist and my wife got the lean. We both enjoyed our choices immensely. I will definitely go back. I wanted some spicy BBQ sauce and apparently they have it but I didn't see it.
neg	Treated with complete disrespect. Worst service I have ever experienced.  After waiting to see the manager I was directed to an employee who committed slander towards me very loudly in front of everyone in the store. Then the manager stepped in spoke robotically without listening and then was incredibly harsh in tone and told me to leave. He said \"leave get out now\"  ****************Don't go to this store/don't use verizon******************
pos	My husband and I have been here twice in the last week for dinner...it is a bit pricey as other reviewers have said (around $20 for dinner entrees) but for vegetarian and organic food what exactly do folks expect?  You get what you pay for.  We were happily surprised after reading the reviews...the food was amazing the portions are huge and we had leftovers both times.  (and p.s. we paid with a debit card both times and have had no trouble despite the review about only paying cash.)  Our first visit we were greeted kindly and given a plate of fruit to munch on until we ordered.  My husband ordered the mint tea and it was delish!  For an appetizer we had the sabzi...which is a huge plate of green herbs homemade wheat nan feta cheese and walnuts.  The herbs were FRESH and the nan was delicious...just the smell of it was enough to get us drooling!  For entrees we had the spinach herb stew and the vegetable stew with eggplant.  I am currently pregnant and garlic is not something that's agreeing with me.  I asked if the vegetable stew had garlic in it and the waiter said \"we can make it however you want...every dish is made when you order it\"....what??  the dishes are made to order??  I haven't heard that at a lot of restaurants!  After about 20 minutes our stews arrived...steaming hot and smelling delicious.  They were HEAVENLY!  So many flavors and so fresh!!  Our second time here we had the dolmeh plate and Mast Va Mosear (a spinach dip)...both were ok...but I like the Sabzi better.  The entrees we had were amazing...I had a special of the day (pomegranate walnut sauce over tofu which was blissful to smell and eat) and hubby had the vegetarian sampler to get his falafel fix.  Overall if you are willing to pay a little more for a nice organic foods dinner go here and check it out.  Everything will be fresh...everything will smell and taste delicious...and the restaurant's atmosphere is perfect for a relaxed decadent evening.
neg	After reading all the good reviews we were looking forward to eating here but we were a bit apprehensive due to the couple of bad reviews because of the smell. Bummer...the smell just killed it for us right from the get go. Immediately upon walking in the door the pungent smell of backed up sewer hit us like a ton-of-bricks. We did a 180 and walked right out. No way I could sit through a meal here while breathing that funk.   Get the smell worked out and we will give you another shot Tasty Thai.
pos	I went here for lunch a couple of weeks ago with my bosses. It was packed on a Friday - we sat at the bar and our cook was fantastic! We got to sit and chat with him while he worked away at the orders. I had the chicken pesto pasty and it was wonderful! the bread used is similar to a pastry dough type...but not as sweet. The pasty was so filling I could barely finish it.  My bosses have been there before and have always wanted to try the peanut butter and jelly pasty - so we all split it as dessert and it was so good. They put bananas in it and drizzle jelly over the whole pasty. It's definitely rich and gooey.   I would totally go back here again and have told my friends about it too! Amazing place.
neg	HORRIBLE---no NON-EXISTENT customer service!  Which is a shame considering they have good pizza.  I ordered 2 pizzas wings a 2 liter and extra ranch; an hour later the delivery guy showed up with 1 pizza and wings.  When I told him that the order was not complete he just rolled his eyes and rudely informed me their online ordering was \"messed up\".  Then shoved the pizza and wings at me without apologizing or offering to correct the mistake.  Problem was I had already been charged for the whole order so I was not about to take less than half of what I paid for.  I told him to cancel the order and he turned and stomped away without another word.  I immediately called the store to make sure I would be credited for my screwed up order that the delivery guy made no attempt to correct.  I asked for the manager when they answered.  The girl who answered said to someone in the background (without putting me on hold so I heard every word): \"Someone wants a manager.  I guess that is you.\"  The  \"manager\" told her he didn't have time to talk to customers and proceeded to yell at her about all the work he had to do....uh- FYI buddy customers are THE REASON YOU ARE IN BUSINESS so it would be a good idea to make time for them!!!! The poor girl came back to the phone after being totally berated by the manager and I told her what had happened with my order. She offered to credit my card for the order.  Only problem is it takes 48 hours to process.  So now I am out $40 for the next few days I have waited over an hour and still have no dinner and I was treated horribly by not one (delivery driver) but two (manager) Mama Mia employees.  I told the girl on the phone that the delivery guy and manager should not treat customers so rudely she apologetically agreed.  I asked for the contact information of the owner; if this were my business I would want someone to let me know if my employees were treating customers like dirt.  She could not provide the contact information but offered to call someone named Frank and have him call me back to resolve the situation.  I never received a call.  Apparently the \"customers are not important\" tone is set at the top in this business.  There are lots of good pizza places in Phoenix save yourself the hassle and the headache order from somewhere that actually knows the meaning of customer service.
pos	This is an adorable little gallery located in the middle of nowhere Downtown Phoenix.  My art teacher friend got fixated on bringing me here when she heard me complaining about Phoenix being chain hell (and thanks to her and Yelp I don't believe that anymore).  I think she chose wisely as I loved this little space.    It was a nice place to stop and check out and then of course we had lunch at the attached City Bakery.  A perfect activity for a half-day of school!  Hooray creativity and uniqueness!
neg	A friend was visiting from out of town and we decided we wanted a pampering experience.  So rather than go to my neighborhood mani/pedi place we went over to old town scottsdale for lunch and a (we hoped) luxurious pedicure.  This place looked very promising and the lady at the front really talked them up so we took the plunge.    Everything seemed promising . . . we waited in a lovely outdoor area until they were ready for us.  Then . . . disappointment.  The pedicure was nothing I couldn't get for half the price the massage chairs just vibrated my feet were still a little rough afterward and the paint job wasn't even that good.    Basically this was VERY overpriced for what was an incredibly unexceptional pedicure.  We still enjoyed ourselves but agreed we would never go back there.
pos	Very very nice family owned bookstore that allows you to trade in your books and buy other books for half price. The owners have also recommended many books/authors to my family over the years.  I came in today still seeking a book that I have gone to numerous libraries looking for. I found a copy on the shelf that was much bigger than an ordinary paperback. I asked if they might have any additional copies. The owner was so nice and went in the back room not once but twice to find me the book and it's sequel. I was so thrilled to have found the books!  I believe that almost every year they have a book clearance where they sell off many books for only $1. I won't be in town for it but if anyone is I recommend checking it out!
neg	Went there first thing thing this morning. Ordered 2 simple sandwiches. Took over 35 minutes to make. 6 workers lounging around. Completely ignored. Totally disgusted with their service. Overpriced. Food okay and felt worthless when I left
pos	OK so this is how much I love this product. I first tasted Lee's at a Yelp Elite event and waited and dreamed a whole year to eat it again. When I was invited to the next year's Elite Pleydate it was the topic of the first question out of my mouth. \"Is Lee's gonna be there?\" ( Ok maybe the whole French restaurant's Bone Marrow gravy came to mind too but I digress) When I made it inside to Pleydate I literally ran to that booth having desert before dinner. I am all about the alcohol infused ice cream now. The funny thing about that is I am not even a big ice cream lover. I will have to visit the shop soon.
neg	I wouldn't write a review on a franchise unless it pissed me off. I prefer Papa John's pizza to Dominos or Pizza Hut (by far) but there are some major service issues that have made my five ordering experiences pretty irritating.  They can't find my house. It's not hard to find I swear. It's a piece of cake and a stone's throw from a major crossroad. They had once taken two hours to deliver a pizza saying they tried to call me (they didn't) only to return to the store and bring it back once I called. Naturally I was delivered a lukewarm pizza but in the nicest way possible was told that it was *my* mistake.  Unacceptable in the age of online ordering and GPS systems in our phones there is no excuse for getting lost in what is essentially a three mile drive in a straight line.   Without complaining I had received a coupon for a free large pizza. Apology accepted. Upon visiting the store I got to keep the card *after* ordering because they gave me the wrong toppings. Suckers.  Also they always take longer than the ETA even in the middle of a weekday. Even now I am waiting 70 minutes for a 30-40 minute order and when I had called 15 minutes ago was told it was on its way but that construction was holding it up. Yes there is construction but you have taken this long in the past without it. Also construction would not explain why it takes nearly an hour to produce one large pizza. I even tip nicely.  I enjoy Papa John's pizza but unless my complaints are addressed I will never order from this location again. I will encourage my friends to follow suit. RAWR.
pos	If you are a big tea drinker like myself then you must check this place out! They offer a HUGE variety of loose teas from all around the world. They have herbal rooibos green black and white teas. The selection is phenomenal and there is some loose teas here for every type of tea drinker out there. They also offer high quality tea accessories that are beautiful like the teapots and tea mugs which are very classy and not overly expensive. Great place for those looking to pick up a unique gift for a tea lover or for the tea lovers like myself it is like stepping into tea HEAVEN. The owner is also very nice and offers good advice if you are looking for a particular taste or type of tea since there are at least 50-60 loose teas to choose from. Hear my teapot whistling......gotta go!
neg	It is what you would expect from any themed place called \"Heart Attack Grill\".  Mirrors on the bottom part of the bar so you can see up the skimpy outfits the \"nurses\" wear at the bar.  Van in the drive through section is painted to look like an Ambulance.  Hamburgers are named after cardiac events.  The food was bad greasy unlimited fries and a giant hamburger that tasted as if they mixed in filler of some kind we had never experienced before.  If you plan on going enjoy the experience cause the food will not be something you would head back for again.
pos	I go to Regio's a lot; today I went and want to reiterate how great I think it is.  I have been going there for a couple years - have never been disappointed in anything I've ordered.  Their beans are delicious as is their menudo (only on Saturday and Sunday unfortunately) and eveything else: tacos burritos enchiladas chile rellenos etc etc etc. is great.  It is so inexpensive it's hard to believe.  Today my bff and I had 5 tacos and an order of beans (between us) and it was $10. HELLO! We had the mini-tacos but we were stuffed and left there saying how wonderful it was and how full we were.   Check it out next time you're in the mood for some awesome authentic Mexican food.  You will be glad you did.  Yummy.
neg	I got a BBQ chicken sandwich and all the bones came complementary! SICK!  I almost broke my teeth when I bit into it.  The service was even worse the manager (I think) stood in the way of me ordering while he was talking on the phone about football for about 10 min.GROSS!
pos	Every time I head to ABC cake supply I see this wonderful store on the way. I often say \"I need to stop there.\" Today I did. It is a wonderful ecclectic store filled with unique items. From baby wedding kitchen and on! I picked up some of their mini cupcake stands! LOVE!!!
neg	AWFUL!!! HORRIBLE!!!!! IT was just HORRIBLE experience!   I made an appointment for mani and pedi and came in Friday morning at 10 am. There was only one lady working there (no bage with her name) She said she could take me earlier than 10. I said it's fine she asked me  to pay cash right away! only cash she said!! And ask me to go to ATM to get cash! I was surprised but didn;t think anything bad. Later I realized that I didnt get any reciept so she just put my cash in her pocket because there were noone else there at that time.  She started with manicure and it took her less than 10 min!! everything was done in 10 min! She didnt even the nails didnt remove the cuticule -she just polished the nailes with an old file. Her work was so nigligent in everything! Nail polish was all around the nails and my finger tips. I suggested her to correct it and remove an extra polish around and she did it only on few nails repeating all the time :\"Pretty? Yes?\" It was so far from looking pretty!  I'm a polite person by nature and never argue but here it was just awful! And I payed her first together with the tips so she took 45 bucks from me  Her pedi was not better at all!! She was always in a hurry! She didnt let my nails  dry and started putting my shoes on me! I warned her that it must have been not done yet but she didnt listen she wanted to get rid of me as soon as possible so all the nails went messy!!! She reapplied the polish but the whole procedure was just so frustrating!! I left the place more than just upset-I was really mad!    The next day the nail polish started to chip off on every other finger! OMG! I wanted to cry! It's the worse mani and pedi I've ever gotten in my entire life and I do it every month!!   I wish I had a reciept and could get back to talk to the manager -but this lady just took my 45 bucks and left me with ugly! really ugly work!!!
pos	I love me some Dobson Ranch.  As far as municipals in the Valley are concerned this is as good as it gets (Aguila is a close second).  No overbearing marshalls.  Rates that top out at $28 in the winter.  Above average range and practice area including two large putting greens.  Cheap pitchers of beer.  A long-time cart lady who will spray your face with water in the summer!    As far as the course itself this is not typical AZ golf - there are no cacti only tree-lined fairways and some water sprinkled throughout to pose as threats.    But there are birdies to be had and lots of them; #1 3 5 7 10 13 15 and 18 are the best chances in my experience (I consider this my home course).  The greens are usually pretty moderate speed to slow - this is grainy bermuda not some hybrid or bent grass so prepare to run the putts into the back of the hole.  #5 is my favorite hole a short-par 5 that gives you the chance to hit over a tree left and drive the narrow fairway leaving you a long to mid-iron into an elevated green that slopes toward you.  #8 is a formidable challenge if you have the tendency to block (or slice as may be the case) the ball from time-to-time as your ball will face a watery grave.  #16 is a tricky tree-lined hole with a tight driving area and doglegs right.  And finally #18 a short par 5 that is easily reachable and where a par feels like a bogey.  A scant 6600 yds from the blue tees (but rarely plays it's full length) there are some low scores out there.  A great course value practice area and recently renovated restaurant and bar - 5 stars.
neg	Warning: Douche Bag level CODE RED!  Here's how my experience went ...   Me: \"May I have a Carmel Latte?\"  Employee: \"No\" .... dead air ... Me: \"Ummm why not?\" Employee: \"We don't have carmel\" Me: \"Ummm I guess I'll just have a Cappuccino then\" Employee: \"Just so you know it's a REAL Cappuccino\" Me: \"Okay\" (in my head I'm trying to figure out if I can legally punch this dickhead in the face or not).  So I sat down mulling over this experience in the dank dark atmosphere while listening to this ass wipe talk to his friend about living on other peoples couches for the past few months and about how he'll be moving to downtown Phoenix soon. To which I just chuckled to myself as this person was FAR from cool enough to blend into CenPho. What a complete and utter douche bag. Stay in Tempe poser (and keep your employer there to!).  This experience was months ago and now they have opened up a shop downtown. Guess what? I'm not going to check them out. Fuck you Cartel. You'll never be Lux so just stay in Tempe where you can be a complete poser with an attitude that you haven't earned.  Complete FAIL.   For my two cents skip this place and go to Lux in CenPho/Mid Town right off the Light Rail. Authentically cool with ZERO attitude great coffee and no douche bag employees.   And as for great coffee ... try Conspire WAY better coffee and authenticly cool.  ----  please read \"owners comment\" below ... here's my response ...  ---- Wow so the coffee snobbery continues with the owner ... I guess my new job  should be to \"promote good coffee in Arizona\" ... and I don't appreciate good coffee because I enjoy the combination of caramel AND coffee ...   By that definition I guess I don't know good ice cream because I like hot fudge on it or good pizza because I enjoy pepperoni AND cheese or good music if it's not acoustic or a good voice unless it's A cappella ... thanks for proving my point. I wouldn't go here unless you are a total coffee snob ... (I guess) they don't need your business you poser!
pos	Mouth watering. That's all I have to say.  The food at this place is seriously amazing. Everything we tasted was better than the dish before it and we had a fabulous bottle of white wine to accompany our meal. The scallops were a highlight as was the potato pie dish (that's not a very technical name for what it was but that's my best effort). It was all very very good and the only thing keeping us from returning is the cost! We genuinely enjoyed our evening here and we will absolutely go back but it is pricey especially for the size of the dishes.  The atmosphere and ambiance are so fun and this place is a little dressier and trendier than some other places we've been in Scottsdale. I highly recommend this for a night out with friends or a cool date night. It seemed as though reservations would be a good idea although we didn't have them and were okay (it was busy though).
neg	I ate at Scramble last Friday and I have to say that it was a horrible experience.  What attracted me to this place was the separate vegan menu in addition to their regular menu - this makes things easier when dining with vegan and non-vegan friends.  So I happily ordered a tofu wrap and added fried potatoes as a side and awaited my food.  We started eating and my friend found a hair in his food...not good!  He threw it on the floor and tried to drop it.  Well moments later I found a hair in my food...  I couldn't believe there was hair on both of our plates!  I was so disgusted I could no longer eat my food (and I was ravenous).  I told the girl working the register about the whole ordeal she walked back to the kitchen then back to the register and completely ignored me (she said she'd come back to my table).  Before we left I spoke with someone else and showed them the hair clearly not one of mine.  All I got was \"Oh I'll check the guys in the back.\"  Check the guys in the back???  What?  How about sorry may I refund you your money?  Additionally the few bites I had of my burrito were pretty bland it needed seasoning or hot sauce.  Overall I wouldn't go back...unless I somehow develop a taste for hair although I'm sure that won't happen.  I did take a picture of my food before I attempted eating it and if you zoom in enough you can see part of the hair sticking out of my food - I'll be posting them.
pos	IKEA is so much fun. It's a little bit of a walk up and down the store but with all the different items on display there is time to sit and relax on the chairs couches beds. I love walking around the store looking a new ideas for my own home. They have very good prices on all household items. When shopping for accessories for the house I highly recommend going to IKEA because you are bound to find something. Simple things such as Tupperware trash cans bathroom accessories can all be found at a really good price.
neg	despite it's billing as the 'largest thrift store in north america' i'm pretty sure this is the island of misfit goodwill items. the place is huge but i've never ever found anything good in this store. i'm not sure how that's possible. but i would never go out of my way to shop here.  i have no bathroom report for this location because i've never been in there long enough to actually go.
pos	This review is for Gil's catering - which is fantastic.    Our perfect event for a new product launch needed to be casual but tasty and high quality.  Gil's was all of these things.  The food presentation is pretty without pretension.  Everything was fantastic.  Best of all Gil worked with us to plan an event within our budget.    Fare is traditional with a tasty twist - our group loved the chimis taquitos enchiladas and especially the chips.    We expected 2 servers and 4 showed up - including Gil.  They over delivered in every sense.
neg	I was really disappointed with my local Baja Fresh tonight.  The lobby salsa bar and even drink station were very dirty and unkept.  To top that off my salad had old dark colored guacamole and limp lettuce.  I hope they read this and will do a better job at cleaning up!
pos	Enjoyed the egg rolls.  So glad that they were made out of fried rice paper because I have food allergies.  The entree of BBQ beef with rice noodles was also very good.  I will be going back this weekend with the hubby for sure.  Very clean and nicely decorated restaurant.  Very nice waitress. The restaurant smelled really good too: spices maybe?  A bit warmer than I would like inside.  Maybe they need to turn up the A/C.
neg	I have been here once for lunch and sat outside only to get eaten alive by flies nothing worse than eating outside on a nice patio and being pestered the entire time.   I decided to give it another chance for happy hour well guess what? flies followed me inside too.   I don't know if it was the time of year (early spring) or what but they really need an exterminator!
pos	My wife and I celebrated our anniversary here for the first time. I have nothing but good things to say. Food wait staff and overall experience were excellent. This is an old school type of steakhouse with red velvet wallpaper leather booths etc. If you haven't been I can't recommend it highly enough. Give it a try and you'll be glad you did!
neg	I used to always go here for tires until my mechanic noticed my tires were the incorrect size.  Back to Discount I go to correct the problem and they blamed me. I was told that I must have chosen the smaller tires to save 20 bucks a tire.  I ended up having to spend a lot of money on five new tires (my spare is a full size as well) three weeks before Christmas. I wrote the company a letter to tell them how wrong I felt the entire experience was and I never heard anything back.  I will not be going here for future tire needs.
pos	We came here the weekend of the Grand Opening. I will say we were very impressed and  there was so much to choose from at this new and improved Pets Mart.  There is a Hotel here for Cats and Dogs. There is a Banner Pet hospital and there is a Grooming station as well as a Dog training store as well. Talk about your one stop shopping. I even got to hold a beautiful baby girl Pug just 6 weeks old. She was absolutly adorable.   We took a picture but have not figured out how to download it yet. Nice and Clean all throughout the store . We purchased a few items and then we were on our way.  Lots of Parking in the lot. Plus nice clean human bathrooms.
neg	The music is pounding...  It reeks of ridiculously strong cologne masking young adult male insecurity...  Some guy younger than my kid brother is walking around without a shirt...  Everything is super overpriced for what you get...  In the grand tradition of overcompensation and brand whoring there is a name plastered all over everything...  No one is genuine either in their efforts to help or able to make real eye contact and stop texting...  Is it a bar in Belltown in the late 90s? Is it a frat party? Is it a spring break trip?  No it's Pimpercrombie & Bitch! Now I remember why it had been at least ten years since the last time I walked in one of these cesspools of humanity and child labor sweatshops. Maybe next time I will wait 20 years...if they make it that long.
pos	A great family owned restaurant! Their lunch specials are very reasonable. I recommend this place to anyone looking for good Japanese food. My only request is that they open a restaurant closer to Tempe - I would go so much more often.
neg	Staff was very rude bowling prices weren't displayed to the best of their ability extreme bowling itself was over priced almost $20 per person. The only thing about their extreme bowling was that it was extremely hot temperature wise. they had many ceiling fans and not one of them turned on. And the bowling equipment malfunctioned three times during our games. It was not a pleasant experience and I don't believe we'll be going to this facility again.
pos	My work got some Christmas allowance and instead of doing a dinner we decided to get a really nice lunch for our branch. We decided on Oregano's cause it was on the way.   I had the stuffed Italian sandwich and it blew my mind. I couldn't believe how bug this sandwich was it provided me with two wonderful lunches.   It looks like some of my coworkers got the sausage sandwich and the steak sandwich and one person got a pasta dish and couldn't even eat a quarter of it because they gave so much.   After that experience I am going to make more of an effort to get to the restaurant instead of getting it to go.
neg	ok so here's what they teach:  if you are a good person it is right and good for you to take from others and give it to yourself because you deserve it and everyone else is a bad person.  Stealing is okay lying is okay as long as it is done by you but for the others they have no place in society so pillage and destroy them it is your right and you will be rewarded for that.  Wow.
pos	As I passed the velvet rope flanked by shiny exotic cars I knew I was in for an experience.  Some might call it a fine-dining experience but clearly this was something more.  A tribute to opulence and Regan-era excess Dominick's is your seven-figure foodie fantasy come alive; from the moment you enter the swanky foyer to the gleaming 10 inch tower of tiramisu that finishes your meal.  It's glittery bedazzled and oozing pretension - and I loved it.  The Service My visit to Dominick's was the night after it's official opening.  The service tried very hard to be as impeccable as the surroundings and while not perfect the charming staff and the sincere effort put forth made little things like missing napkins and bread plates instantly forgivable.  Our server Drew let us know that the wait staff only had 2 - 3 tables each and it was very evident in the personal service we received.  A few more weeks of experience for the staff should easily iron out the little wrinkles.  The Food We started with the jumbo shrimp appetizer which unfortunately came with 3 shrimp - hardly conducive to sharing - so we ordered two. And \"Jumbo\" they certainly were accompanied by a kicky cocktail sauce which my dinner companion felt was spicy enough.  Ever the daredevil I added additional horseradish to mine because who doesn't like to burn the inside of their nostrils at dinner. For the main course we both had the 9-oz filet lobster gnocchi and steamed asparagus.  My filet was a perfect rare-plus with a dark pink center expertly seared and juicy. Surprisingly the lobster gnocchi really stole the show for me.  I'm not big on starches or cream sauces so when it was suggested I wasn't particularly excited; I should have been.  The dough was light and fluffy the cream sauce not too rich and the lobster added the perfect amount of salt & texture. After dinner I indulged in a grand marnier while my companion ordered the tiramisu.  He was presented with a 10 inch tall hunk of cake that could easily have been intended for 4 people.  The tiramisu was spongy and light with a lovely cool custard and only a subtle flavor of rum.  A nice finish to an excellent meal.    Atmosphere We were lucky enough to score a poolside table which started off as very romantic but over the course of the evening became quite the place for people watching.  The scene at the small bar area on the 2nd floor was bustling and both the waiters and I wondered aloud how long it would be before a guest fell in the pool.  I bet they didn't make it through the weekend without someone making a splash.
neg	I do not like this KFC ...or any really for that matter. Every time I have been here the place is filthy. I know they remolded the place and I have not been since then so I am not sure if the conditions are the same.  The food is just not good in any way anymore. Not that it was ever great but you could get some decent chicken and some sides and be content. What the hell have they done to the mac & cheese? It is so gross..the color is just not appealing and the taste is worse. Food at this place has been served under temperature enough times to keep me from returning.
pos	I Love this place. I eat here either take in or take out at least 2 times a week!  I also agree with some of the others. I love the fact that I can try something new without committing! I love the revolving sushi. I also do not like that there are a lot of spicy selections. Why not offer the spice on the side. I would love some of the sushi but it has that spicy sauce on it.  Some of the best to offer that some people might not know about:  Haru sushi - Tuna stuffed with crab and topped with avocado! Hand rolls - YUM!!! Some are only 2.50 Udon - Good!  The staff is great. The wait can be long on some days or eves.  Love the baked scallops. Great mussels too.
neg	So a friend of mine went here last Friday and they were double charged.  The bartender took advantage of the situation and threw out the receipt to avoid cancelling the $60 amount. Which she claims and assumes was her tip (on a $60 bill). \"I get a 100\% tips!\" umm..yeah.. I think I will skip this place for sure!
pos	Very nice neighborhood spot.  The mussels are great and both pork dishes we tried were outstanding.  The Bacon-Cheddar biscuits make the meal and Fig pecan pie is the perfect finish.
neg	Terrible food terrible service.  I ordered chicken fried rice. The waiter brings me a bowl and says \"chicken fried rice right?\" I look into the bowl and it's a bowl of brown rice. This must be a joke. I tell him that's wrong and next me brings me a bowl of rice seemingly fried? with vegetables and no chicken. I bring that back to the counter and say my order had chicken in it bringing my receipt along. So finally they bring me a bowl of chicken fried rice.  Or at least their version of it.  I didn't think it was possible to actually screw up something as simple as chicken fried rice. The rice itself was cheap long grain rice. It was inedible due to the how stale/hard it was. Like absolutely no water absorption. And the rice was all covered in something that made it very wet and practically slimy. Disgusting. I have no idea how people can eat this.  Oh and that server who brought me the brown rice and claimed it was fried rice tried to bring lettuce wraps to the table next to me saying it was their salad. There's a nice picture on the wall which shows you what the salad is supposed to look like and it's not lettuce wraps.  The best thing about my meal was the fountain drink which cost $1.85. The Circle K in the same plaza has bigger cups for 99 cents.
pos	I had a tough time deciding between 4 and 5 stars.  Wish there was 4.5 stars available for me to choose.  Went here on a business trip with a coworker and tried it out. I had at least one of the following: Sapporo - Can it ever be bad?  It was served very cold.  Thumbs up. Green Tea - Good.  Good service on the refills also. Edamame - Good.  Right amount of salt. Miso - Interesting wooden bowl and wooden spoon.  It tasted good tho. Yellow Tail Salmon Tuna Albacore Uni FW Eel  Kampachi nigiri.  Good stuff on all of those.  They also have \"Yasu style\" nigiri for some types and they are good.  It usually involves ponzu on top. Spicy Tuna and Softshell Crab roll.  SSC was great!  Service was pretty good and sushi was also good.  The bar was full but I wish I could have eaten there.  The sushi chefs were friendly and talkative to the people at the bar which is unusual (at least compared to LA).  The base quality of the fish outside of whatever ponzu soy wasabi and other ingredients were on it was pretty good but I wouldn't say 5 stars.  Since I generally judge a place wholly on the food I give it 4.5.  Failing that I rounded up!
neg	UPDATE: This location is closed. Boo!
pos	I love this place.  The first time I went I had my mom and my sister with me.  We all got pedicures and by far the best foot massages I've had at any of these nail places.  The thing that really impresses me the most is that after only one visit... the next time I came in- they greeted me by my name. How often does that happen?  Hello customer service- welcome back.  It's husband and wife owned and operated and they are as nice as can be. Love it here.  Great atmosphere friendly good service affordable.  You won't be disappointed.
neg	The Management Group at this location need to make a better effort to control the number of people jumping theaters.  My experience at this theater was one of the worst that I have ever had.  I will never go back to that theater again.  I felt that it was nothing but a complete money grab.
pos	Mid-priced dining with high end flavor. I ordered the special Yelp menu. Started off with mixed green salad with fig dressing. Very good. Moved on the the \"smart\" chicken. Tender char grilled breast with corn risotto. Yum!  Topped it off with a perfect chocolate de creme. Staff was friendly and very on top of things. Great experience.  I'm definitely coming back. give these guys some love!
neg	My husband and I were really really disappointed with our experience at Coulter Infiniti.  We brought our 2006 G37 with barely 34000 miles (and out of warranty) to have the moon roof looked at.  The moon roof wouldn't open or close but you could hear the motor working.  After leaving the car there all day we get a call that the car needs a whole new moon roof track - which would cost over $3000.  We contacted their corporate office to attempt to get some or all of the cost covered due to the fact that it's a big repair and the car  is barely out of warranty.  We were flat out denied.  Twice.    We were dreading the big repair and decided to bring the car to a different auto shop (which will get a big fat 5 star review) for a second opinion.  Turns out the track just had a BUILD UP OF DIRT AND DEBRIS and needed to be cleaned out.  Seriously?!?!  Just over $100 later we were on our way!  I find it VERY hard to believe that Coulter didn't know this was the problem.  We are now searching for a new SUV and will not be choosing Infiniti.  How disappointing.
pos	Still loving Sunflower after a year and a half.  I actually moved houses to be closer to this grocery store.  The staff have never complained about going an extra mile the prices have stayed better than any store I've been to lately and they have been having great beer specials.  Special note:  They have a large selection of homeopathic and environmentally sound products for your everyday corporal adjustments.  Tons of specialty soaps herbal supplements and vitamins.  Check for the solution here before going to chain pharmacies!
neg	I have have been going to Bosa off and on since they opened. Have a bad experience and stop for a while. Then I tell myself \" It's right down the street why not \" then disappointment again.   1. Went in on a Fri at 630AM for their special curler donuts that they ONLY do on Fri. Sure enough nothing was prepared. Was informed it would take another 30 min to finish the donuts. Noticeable very very very irritated I ordered 2 other donuts instead. Was planning on a dozen but had to settle for what they had. Well staff made sure to charge me a credit card fee due to my purchase being under $ 5.00. When you don't have what you advertise you might want to waive the .50 fee. Or you will really piss off that customer. Common sense.  2. Customer service is horrible. See #1.  3. When I get home I have never received the correct dozen donuts I ordered. I don't understand it ???? I'm perplexed ??? I don't think it's anything personal. I just never get the correct dozen. They close the box I pay and go home. Surprise.  The donuts are OK nothing great and not bad they are donuts. They are convenient and close but I must remember to pass on Bosa Donuts.
pos	Ace and fried mushrooms at Casey's. My version of heaven.   The food is good and the beer is even better but what people really go for is the ambiance. The most awesome potpourri of people. Old young but always interesting.  Say hi to Thomas the cat for me! He's chilling with the patrons when ever it's not too crowded.
neg	I will be moving to Phoenix in the Winter and I thought I'd scout out some LFS while I was visiting which led me to Reef Culture. At first I was positive seeing some nice looking displays and LED use however this soon changed.   On closer inspection lots of the tanks were infested with aiptasia and bubble algae and prices of coral were hugely inflated compared to other prices in the area and back home. The people were very unprofessional and unfriendly and first ignored me entirely despite trying to flag someone down. When I did manage to get their attention I was belittled and treated like a child who knew nothing about the hobby (I have had marine tanks for over a decade ranging from large 55 gallon+ to tiny DIY LED picos).   After this rude and demeaning experience I continued to peruse the last few tanks and came across an angler fish. I watched him and he followed me as I walked down the isle as far as his tank would go and I backtracked a couple steps amused that he was slowly walking along the tank with me. There was a loud crack as the man behind the counter slammed the phone down snapped his fingers at me and told me to \"stop harassing the fish.\" Keep in mind I was not tapping on glass or prodding anything as I am quite short and I could barely reach to the high up tank where the angler fish was much less reach to \"harass\" any fish. After this rude treatment I promptly left. This kind of unprofessional treatment of the customers is shocking and unacceptable not to mention the bubble algae infested tanks (one spore of that on the water that you get your coral in and your tank is infected too).   I won't be doing business here when I move.
pos	Top notch cheesesteak. One of the best in the valley. This place has a large delivery area and is located right by campus. The owners are really nice and friendly. I'm really glad something moved into this spot. It's so convenient.   Their desserts are great as well. I wish they had some chicken options but they are new and said they would be adding to the menu as time goes on. My girlfriend said the turkey sandwich was fantastic. They sometimes carry Tasty Kake so ask about that.   I've had the authentic cheesesteaks from Philly and this tastes every bit as good if not better. It's definitely in my top 5 local cheesesteaks.  Edit: Just ordered delivery - Lightning fast! This place is incredibly legit. I went with a cheesesteak with White American cheese instead of \"wiz\" this time - So incredibly good. They tossed in a new dessert they didn't have last time which was awesome.   Their prices are really good and their food is so delicious. I'm a huge fan. I'm not kidding with this 5 star rating - I love this place. Rave rave rave...
neg	Very bad food!
pos	The Westin Kierland is a beautiful resort located in PHOENIX not Scottsdale.   Some close friends of mine from Canada stayed in this PHOENIX resort for a few days so I've hung out in its rooms and generally lounged about the property. The rooms were impressive beautifully decorated and spacious. We especially enjoyed taking the kids out to small fire pits maintained on the grounds where guests to our fine city of PHOENIX can roast marshmallows.   The Kierland has some tough competition considering that the city of PHOENIX has every one of the most famous resorts in the Valley from the Biltmore to the Phoenician to the Royal Palms. It does pretty well in a tough line-up. No offense to Scottsdale which also has some great resorts such as the Four Seasons. It's just that the most famous ones are in PHOENIX.

neg	I dont understand how a second restaurant was opened on Tatum . My husband and gave these place too many chances and wach time the food was not impressive. The margaritas come from a stolen recipe from La Pinata Nueva  but too bad they didnt bring the recipes with them. I hope they get it \" that maybe if you put alittle quality in the food people will come back\".
pos	Sprouts is my favorite market to shop at! They are a great company who have a very friendly staff in their stores as well as their corporate office. They are also very involved with the community and with local farmers and businesses!  The prices for all the fresh and natural groceries they carry are the most reasonable out of all the grocery stores I have been too! The Vitamin Department has everything you could ever look for to help your well being and they are always extravaganzas in the stores so you are always getting the most out of your money and in times like these I know people are very appreciative of that since groceries are becoming more and more expensive everyday or so it seems!  I most definitely recommend anyone to shop at Sprouts!
neg	Horrible! I had a gel manicure. The tech didn't let my old gel soak off long enough so she scraped clipped and filed so hard to get it off that it left my natural nail extremely thin and flimsy. The new polish that was put on was thick in some areas and thinner in others. I didn't realize it until I got home. I grabbed my purse and almost broke my naturally long nails because they were so frail. I get the gel manicure because it has a thicker finish and makes my nails firmer. I called and told them about what happened. The gentleman who answered the phone told me that I was wrong and that they would not refund my money. I will never go back and I am sure sorry I ever did in the first place.
pos	I love this place.  Great food great service from some of the nicest staff and just a fun place to go.  It is also a place I like to meet people for happy hour.  They have a wonderful selection of beers fantastic wines and I have never once had anything but great food while eating there.
neg	We were excited to check out this new restaurant! We were left extremely underwhelmed. We sat in the bar to watch MNF. It would have been nice to be able to hear the game over the discordant pop rock music at a mexican establishment but I understand that you are not a \"sports bar\". It was Monday night and with the exception of a large group  of blue hairs celebrating secretary's day the place was empty.  The bar area managed to fill up because the Cardinals were on tv and it seemed as thought the high tops and patio were busy as well.   Our bartender Amanda was very polite and eager to up sell us their flavored tequilas and specialty cocktails. You can tell she was a little wet behind the ears but she was doing her best nothing a little training and experience can't fix. The wait time to receive a cocktail was excruciatingly long though being a former bartender I understand the complexity that new bars go though to develop new and unique cocktails.  We ordered the pumpkin margarita. I applaud the attempt but personally it tasted like puréed baby food.   I was feeling very open minded and wanted to experience as much as I could that TQLA had to offer so we ordered the salsa trio and chicken tortilla soup.    Queso dip: cold Habanero dip: sweet with a swift kick afterwards: not bad Guacamole: good: but was gone after 2 bites. I guess they feel if they place the guacamole on a bed of green shredded lettuce it will look like there is more than delivered. Fail  Chicken tortilla soup: Thick tomato soup with dry dark meat chicken chunks. Maybe it is just me but I prefer a more broth based ck tort soup and juicy white/dark meat chicken. Bleh: Amanda offered to remove it off our bill but I insisted on finishing mine because I was hungry. My GF pushed hers to the side; DNF.   Meanwhile; whilst experience our starters we managed without any silverware or napkins and at this point Amanda being the only bartender on managed to become flooded with specialty cocktails in the well; thus not being able to properly oversee her patrons at the bar. Needles to say our drinks were empty our plates monkey dishes empty bowl of chips 2 cups of bland tortilla soup saucers and wrinkled up black beverage napkins (used in the place of the real ones) were all tattering on the edge of the bar eagerly anticipating a bus boy to remove them.   Onto the Entrees:  I ordered the carne Asada steak.  My girlfriend tried the habanero chicken platter. They were delivered by TQLA manager \"Joe\". Whom decidedly pulled himself from enjoying the football game to expedite some food. He crept up behind us and shuffled the entree platters in front of our faces after we spread our dirty dishes closer to the edge of the bar and politely stacked them for our ficticious busboy/girl to remove them properly. Now in my history with management; a decent manager would offer to remove the collection of dishes but instead he decided to ask us if we needed anything else since the look on our faces was disgust. Instead we opted to inform Joe that we would enjoy our meal a little better with silverware and napkins.  He acknowledged that was a novel concept and proceeded to fetch us a pair. Joe wasn't six steps away before he was interrupted by a member of the waitstaff who informed him that what she needed was more important than delivering two setups to some first time customers so they could enjoy their ever increasingly cold food.  At this point my girlfriends temper got the best of her and she jumped up and retrieved her own silverware off of a table in front of Joe and eager waitress to salvage any heat that might have been left in our entrees.   We dig in:    Carne Asada: was tender but lacking the Wow factor.   Habanero Chicken: Tasted like a chicken breast smothered in their warm fire roasted salsa... What happened to the habaneros?  Where is the heat...? Bland  I hope they get better: but until then Nandos all the way. Never saw Joe touch any tables never offered to help out a bartender who was swimming laps in an Olympic size pool. Occasionally the wait staff would come behind the bar and help out.  This is about the time that our appetizers chips soups and entrees were all removed from the bartop. FYI Joe the hostess stand can hold itself up on its own. You don't have to stand there and hold it up. Keep an eye on your staff and customers and offer help where they need it so people will be happy to come back and give you a second shot.
pos	I had the pleasure of living across the street from this treasure for about 6 years. I'm still lucky enough to work close by.   Let me be clear. I 'm reviewing Haji Baba as a GROCERY STORE first.  Then I will give you some insight into the prepared food for take-out or in-store dining.  This is one of the few stores in Arizona where you have several choices for pita bread--it's also the ONLY place I've found for whole wheat pita. There are several choices for Feta cheese. Danish FrenchGreek...same with olives--there are choices. I ALWAYS buy my tahini here. All the prices are very inexpensive.  Need spices???  They have them all.  At about 25\% of the price you would pay anywhere else. The best way to describe Haji Baba is that it is a REAL grocery store with REAL prices for REAL people.  It is NOT a \"specialty store\" with trendy items and inflated prices.  They sell food items that you will actually use.  The bonus here?  You won't find a 10 year old can or jar of something.  On to the \"restaurant\" portion.  Haji Baba is better if you think of it as a take-out joint that happens to have places to sit and eat.  They do have tables and they do perform table service it's just got zero charm.  You go for the food that's it.  Okay food.  The lamb tongue sandwich is to die for.  Let me repeat.  The LAMB TONGUE PITA SANDWICH.  GET IT!  Their baba ganouj is also darned tootin' tasty.  Actually I sometimes dream about their baba ganouj. I'm not crazy about their hummus maybe because making hummus takes 5 minutes and mine is bomb? But it's not bad. Gyros are good and not greasy. Greasy gyro meat is a pet peeve of mine. Chicken shwarma?  Yup that's good too. I'm sure I've had something  to eat  here that I was a little disappointed in but I honestly can't remember what or when .
neg	Their alcohol slushies are undrinkable and are sure case of gut rot. As far as the place its pretty small you'll probably want to leave after 10 minutes.
pos	Great and has been for years.  Lines out the doors at lunch but worth the wait.  I recommend combo 'K'  This place is the where you should take someone from out of town that wants the best mexican food.
neg	whole foods whole paycheck wholly sh$t i am sorry there prices are rediculous the only reason i went there is because since moving here from a very foody town certain products are nearly impossible to find and they do have them but you will pay my search today was mushroms not button but chantrel/oyster/ect i was going to get every thing on my list but when i saw shallots at 4.95 a lb i bought my shrooms and split the i hit frys shallots 2.49 a lb and of course theres always trader joes
pos	Another great Italian find!  My BF and I went to Roma Garden for dinner last night because he was given a gift certificate there from a friend.  We'd never heard of it but we're always up for trying something new especially with $50 towards our meal.  We pulled up to their strip mall location without expectations and we were both pleasantly surprised!  When you walk in the lighting and decor are welcoming and the staff is friendly and attentive.  It was a Thursday night and there were plenty of other guests in the restaurant and there was a lively energy in the air.  After browsing the menu I ordered one of the few 'Chef's Specials' of the night - tilapia with fresh veggies and pasta in a lemon caper sauce.  BF went with Pollo Parmagiana.  He had a glass of cabernet and I had pinot grigio... and voila - a warm bread basket arrived on our table at just the right time!  We were both happy with our orders when they arrived as well... the fish was cooked just right and the sauce was tasty... good portions as well!  Although we were full we decided to order a dessert to share - the homemade snow white chocolate tartufo - yum!  The perfect sweet ending to our meal.  In addition we were each brought an after dinner drink of amaretto on the rocks on the house.  ****I just have to share that I was pleasantly surprised that the women's restroom was clean spacious and had a fresh fragrance to it - I normally don't notice that but I was impressed by this!  In speaking to the waiter and the owner we learned that this restaurant recently changed locations but they've been in business for over 15 years.  Gotta love the local businesses that last in the valley... we'll be back to support Roma Garden and enjoy their fine \"Northern Italian Cuisine\" without a doubt.  I suggest you go check it out also - bon appetito!
neg	So i thought with all the controversy surrounding this place I would support the first amendment with my wallet. Unfortunately our experience here was subpar to say the least. We came in on a 3pm on Saturday and there was only one other couple inside. We were literally outnumbered by the people working there. I say this because somehow despite this fact the service was HORRENDOUS. I mean we got our order out fine but our waitress dissappeared after that. At one point I had to almost get refills for us myself. The sushi itself was so overpriced for what it was. The Philadelphia roll was decent but the California roll was really bad. When it came to paying I put my credit card in the sleeve and waited for awhile. Despite there being no one else in the restaurant at this point except one other table the waitress didn't return. If it wasn't for the cash I had on me I'd be waisting away there at this moment because she had no intention of returning and I have no intention of ingesting there food ever again!
pos	Love this place...can't beat it for a healthy meal. Tons of good options that are tasty without all the cheese.
neg	Great food can be found anywhere. Great service is one in a million these days. This place gets an A+ in the most awful service I have ever received and if you have/had a Groupon for this place like I did don't even bother going. You'll be treated worse than a bothersome fly on a hot and humid day.  It's simple. Businesses put  their name out by working with daily coupon sites like Groupon LivingSocial etc. to garner new and potential repeat customers. Instead after going there with my handy coupon I can't help but drive by this place on the way home and think nothing but the horrible experience I received.   I went with my boyfriend and bought the Groupon because I was impressed due to online reviews and decided to splurge on a good ole' prime rib. We sit down am impressed with the old school decor and then the server from Azkaban appears. We tell her that we'd like to order off the special evening menu where it's a little cheaper and tell her joyfully that we found this place through Groupon and that it's our first time. Wrong thing to do. I don't know if it's because past Groupon-ers don't tip well or something but I could swear her smile immediately turned 180 degrees in an instant.   It took our food (the chicken and prime rib) almost 33 minutes to come out. All we did was nom ... and nom ... and nom on the watery coleslaw and gritty liver (which isn't to blame since I was never a liver fan). Not once did our server come by our table. We watched her run into the kitchen and either not come back out for a while or attend to other tables. It was another server that came out and gave us our food so we let our frustration go since it wasn't her fault and there's no use in calling her out for nothing. We asked if she knew where our server was and she said she would look for her. 10 minutes later nothing yet it was the new server who kept coming back asking if everything was alright like a normal server should.   Then it was time for the check and we just wanted to get out of there since we were basically ignored. 17 minutes pass no check came even though our  table had been cleared. Our server was still MIA so we asked a random server to give us our check. He said he would tell our server to bring it back and we told him straight up that we didn't even want to see her face so another random server brought it back.  We had a table of 4 sitting next to us who even leaned over and asked us why we were being so calm when our non-existent server was treating us like crap. We didn't even want to bother waiting another 20 minutes just to talk to a manager since apparently the only way the servers here communicate is by playing Telephone so we just left after paying. The table beside us told us that they were going to complain for us since we wanted to leave but whether they did or not I didn't even care at that point.   To be honest I can't even remember what the food tasted like which isn't quite fair in a review. I went here a couple of months ago but I have never had an experience where service overrode the taste of food. I'm pretty sure prisoners in a cafeteria get more attention than I did.  Maybe it wasn't even the Groupon. Who knows. All I know is that we ran out of there like Usain Bolt and tell anyone who asks about our worst dining experience that this is the place to experience it.
pos	Agree with those who describe this place as enchanting.  The rooms are extremely comfortable the grounds are picture perfect and the pools are very pretty.  We had 8 people in our group ages 15-64 and everyone found something they loved about this place.
neg	My fiance and I tried the place because of a Groupon.  We live in the same neighborhood and see the place all the time but the look of the place was never enough to draw us in.  There is nothing eye catching about the business front at all.  It's in a strip mall and looks old.  At night they turn on strands of tacky Christmas lights that only attract attention to the fact that the lights are so poorly hung.  When we arrived for dinner we were greeted by an empty corridor no host station and no host.  We could see what looked to be a bar but it wasn't a bar that I'd want to eat drink and socialize at.  To pass the time until we were finally greeted we browsed the many framed publications touting how incredible the place was.  I'm already here...I don't need any more persuasion.  It's time for the Chef/owner to take down the \"look how good I was\" trophy wall and go with a more inviting modern look.  We were greeted by friendly gentleman who seated us on the main lower floor.  He handed us our menus and asked if he could get us something to drink.  There is no drink menu on the menu.  No beer list no soda list no liquid period.  We asked to see the wine list which had only bottle prices and doesn't even hint that they sell wine by the glass.  Once I asked if they had beer and sold wine by the glass it was like we made a breakthrough.   The menu seems a bit outdated so I  went with the Lasagna the basics.  While we sat waiting for our meal the salads came.  Weird...the menu didn't mention anything about a salad nor did the waiter.   More lack of information from the menu.  Now on to the decor.  It is terribly outdated.  Tacky bland pale paint scheme brass fixtures mirrors and cliche wine bottles.  There were beautiful fresh flowers throughout which we really enjoyed.  I was unfortunately seated directly in front of two paintings both with a woman and a little girl drinking what appears to be wine.  I'm guessing they are personal family paintings but they are horribly out of place and bordering on creepy.  I couldn't take my eyes off of them and that distracted me throughout the night.  This place needs a makeover new modern paint scheme and some updating on the artwork.  The lasagna came.  It was OK at best.  I tried my fiance's chicken genevese at it was horrible.  The chicken tasted like it was boiled which is an instant dish killer for me.  We did not take our leftovers.  We asked for the check and it came with a after dinner cordial which was a nice surprise and tasted delicious.   We won't be back.  To be honest Oregano's lasagna is better by far.
pos	I was sent to Amomi spa from my OBGYN for my  first pregnancy to get all of my ultrasounds.  I felt very at ease the first time I walked in because of the very clean place and friendly staff. Every ultrasound technician I have had has been really great and knowledgable.  I really like that they have high tech equipment with big plasma tv's on the wall so I could see a bigclear picture of the baby. Also the  large spacious rooms are really nice. On a side note they have great products to buy in the lobby.  Now pregnant with my 2nd baby my OB referred me to 2 different places this time for my ultrasounds. Without hesitation I knew I wanted to go back to Amomi spa again to get all of my ultrasounds. I have already been twice this time around and looking forward to going again in a few weeks.
neg	Total bait and switch sales department! Will tell you one price over the phone then quote you another when you arrive! Happened to me personally 3 times. I bought from Scottsdale BMW. One quote one price done deal. Buyer beware...
pos	We had a GREAT dinner there on Saturday.  We were celebrating my aunt's birthday and we ordered from the regular and special menus.  I had a truly wonderful chicken Madiera my hubby had meat loaf which is always a \"tell\" for a good place my uncle had fried haddock which was crunchy and not at all greasy and my aunt also had the chicken Madiera which was fork-tender.  We also had great service - attentive without being too much and we completely enjoyed our meal.  We will definitely visit this location again.
neg	Just don't.
pos	we celebrated my birthday all weekend.  we made the trek to bobby q on sunday. I ordered the brisket sandwich with mac and cheese and let me tell you about that mac & cheese..it was amazing. Mr H went with the chicken and brisket and for his sides: beans and potato salad.   The food is sinfully delicious! I will NOT be coming here as often as I would like... I found it too indulgent. it is definitely a treat and worth trying! I love those little donuts they give you at the end!
neg	What ever you do don't waste your money here.  I am not the person who likes to send food back in fact I hate to do it.  I had no choice here this was by far the worst mexican food I have eaten.  The food has such a horrible after taste.  I not only hated my meal but tried my boyfriends as well and it was still terrible.  The service compares to the food we waited forvever just for a server to come over and greet us.  I wouldn't even recommend this place to my enemies.
pos	I'd been hearing about Defalco's for a while now. My husband Jim W and my youngest Abby raved. \"Best steak grinda since Baston\" they said. So on an expedition to get more raw chocolate we went.  The first thing I noticed was that the tables were scattered among the racks of Italian foodstuffs. I loved that. The place screamed \"Boston\" from the moment we walked in the door. When we ordered Jim found one of my favorite types of soda in the case Doc Brown's diet black cherry. I was in heaven.  So we got our number and sat down. While we were waiting - a short wait - I got a brilliant idea which solved a long-vexing problem. Guess it was the east coast vibe.  The food came and I was in heaven. We split a steak sandwich and red potato salad. Jim likes everything and I just like onions so they gave him the mushrooms and peppers on the side. Lots of mushrooms and peppers. It didn't look like a ton of food but we certainly got enough to eat.  What's not to like at Defalco's? The food is fabulous the prices are good the people are really nice and they have all kinds of imported goodies. So I guess the only thing I didn't like about Defalco's was leaving.
neg	After bad experience I will never return.  It is terrible since they didn't meet my expectation and the price is outrageous.  The most difficult part of the Pho is the broth (req 16 hours of preparation) and it tasted like water.  I had to add all kind of condiments to rescue it but can't even eat it.  The restaurant is very slow now and it confirmed what I meant with Asian restaurant.  If your fellow Asians don't patronize the place it is  because your food did not meet our expectation.  Try across the street to the Rice plate Kim Thanh for their rice dish.  It is night and day.
pos	Incredibly good calzones; friendly service nice courtyard seating.
neg	Was in town for a business meeting and tried to catch a movie with a friend. First impression of the place was that it needed a total make over.  I mean TOTAL MAKEOVER. Walked up to buy my ticket and the lady was a total jerk! She had no idea when the movie times were and she clearly thought we were stupid. She messed up our change and didn't believe us when we told her. When we walked in they ripped the tickets out of our hands.  When it came time to order our food the butter on the popcorn tasted like cough syrup. The theater was extremely dirty and kids were screaming throughout the movie.  After the movie I politely told the manager about our horrible experience.  He was not understanding at all and even threatened to kick us out. I was appaled by this whole endeavor and that is why I am writing this review. It was a complete waste of time and money and I recommend everyone to stay away.
pos	Nic-nacs galore!
neg	I'd have to disagree with the person who said this restaurant is dog friendly.  I was told off by the owner because I had a little dog outside table and that was right after I finished paying for an overpriced breakfast dish and coffee.  I went here before that on several occasions and many times my order was forgotten after paying....and the staff is real unprofessional blasting music at nightclub volume at early breakfast and lunch times.  I'm a neighbor but will never go here again!!!!
pos	After talking to a number of bartenders in the area -- and doing some fairly extensive personal research -- I feel pretty comfortable saying that if you want the best cocktails in the Phoenix area you should head to the Jade Bar at the Sanctuary Resort.    This is off the beaten path a bit and after a few miles down streets with no street lights it felt a bit like driving to a ski lodge up in the mountains.  It's worth the drive though.  I had two excellent cocktails (\"The Last Word\" and a \"Pendemums Club\") and one enjoyable and informative conversation with Jillian the bartender.  Wish I could have made some of their mixology classes.
neg	I'll be charitable - this place sucks!  I went there because a friend had *exactly* the piece of furniture I needed and he got his from Ikea.   After wandering around the store forever I finally found the right department.  The people working there were cold. uncaring. not helpful. no concept of customer service.  I left in disgust!  Couple of days later I was in Cost Plus World Market @ 18th St. & Camelback.  Voila!  I fould what I wanted - for close to the same price.  the BIG difference:  Warm smiles friendly people volunteered to go out of their way to help me.  Felt like I was among long-time friends!  They even delivered when they said they would.  And no need to drive half way to tucson and back!  Ikea?  Don't be foolish.  Cost Plus?  Now there's a place that earned my repeat business!
pos	What an amazing Mini Vacation.  I went in August which was about 105 degrees but it was perfect.  The pool was relaxing the water felt great and I enjoyed all three nights of my stay.  We decided it was so great we never left the resort.    The Room was very clean and very comfortable.    Talavera had the most amazing Fish Entrees the seabase OMG I can still taste it the salmon was the best I have ever had and I dislike salmon completely.  The service through out the restaurant and hotel was amazing.  The special drinks they had were very tasty and made the 105 degrees weather manageable.    The brunch buffet and breakfast at Crescent Moon is excellent all three days so fresh the pomegranate fresh juice was amazing I had three.  The food tasted like the items were freshly picked that morning.  I literally gained 5 ILBs on this trip and it was worth all of it.    The Lounge had tasty small Tapas which I enjoyed while it drizzled that night the whole hotel has a great relaxing ambiance.  The nights were amazing to walk around the hotel or sit around the pool with the night lights on and enjoy the peacefulness of the resort.  I believe we saw bats flying around in the middle of the night. which was very cool.    Worth every penny.  Just watch out for Camera Speed Traps on the way there.  Enjoy
neg	I just had a pretty unfortunate experience at Bison Witches in Tempe.  I remember liking this place when I went to ASU but not anymore!  It literally (no exaggeration) took 1.5 hours for our lunch which was 3 people eating soups and sandwiches.  Our order took 45 minutes to arrive at our table (again soup and sandwiches!) and several tables around us that had come in AFTER us got food before us.  I normally am pretty easy going about stuff like this but the server and a guy that appeared to be a manager/owner didn't even acknowledge the long wait time no apology nothing.  They weren't even that busy!  Our server barely even spoke to us when she came to the table and acted like we were inconveniencing her.  I also saw her roll her eyes at another one of her tables as they got up to leave.  What kind of service is that!?  I wish I could say the food was any saving grace but it wasn't.  Mediocre soup in a bread bowl less than mediocre turkey on a bland sandwich.  I will NOT be going back there's no point!  Save your time and money and hit up another one of the tasty places on Mill Ave.  Trust me you'll be better off!
pos	Delicious barbecue we had 4 meats platter that we split with three people.  The pulled chicken is amazing the brisket tender and juicy the ribs succulent and flavorful best barbecue around.  The sides were delicious as well mac & cheese was great mashed potatoes did not disappoint ranch beans aren't anything special but they tasted good.    Service was great waiter was attentive to our needs and accommodated a last minute switch after already putting in the order. Atmosphere is good not too noisy/quiet the lighting could be improved though a single bulb above the table barely allows you to see what you are eating though the food wasn't there long enough to be seen:)  Highly recommended to someone looking for great barbecue ribs chicken brisket etc.
neg	Filthy place.  Bad tasteless food.  Rude waitress.  Yuck!!!!
pos	Lovely outdoor seating area very dog friendly. Don't sit in the back of the outdoor seating area because it smells like propane back there. Had some coffee and just hung out for a couple of hours. It was a pleasant experience. Didn't order food this time but next time I will because every dish that came by looked magnificent! All of the prices on the menu looked very reasonable for the portion.
neg	Poor service-small portions-pricey
pos	Excellent in every way.  Attentive and fun owners who tend bar every weekend night - GREAT live music excellent wine selection.   Keeping Fountain Hills young.... one weekend at a time.
neg	This place is a dump. I'm a widow and I have a long-term chronic condition still they allowed their tenant to pick on me throw a bottle at me then their maintenance person told me the lock was never changed They did not paint but lied and said they did. It's totally drug-infested They don't keep their word.  I would skip it.
pos	This place is such a delightful treat. Not only is the Barrio Cafe in what some Phoenicians would called the actual barrio but it's non-descript on the outside and purely magical within. Not terribly difficult you keep your eyes peeled Barrio Cafe is one of the best Mexican restaurants in Arizona and is a must try for any Phoenix local.   You really can't go wrong with anything on their menu although their seafood offerings are my least favorites. I am in love with their conchita pibil which is their slow-roasted pork and they have the best made-at-the-table guacamole in all of Phoenix. Their food is the kind of special occasion dinner that you and all your guests will be savoring every morsel but save room for one of their delectable desserts! I'm a fan of their flan in particular.   Service is spot on and it's usually pretty packed so come as early as you can or face a semi-long wait at the bar. Don't worry though they've got great margaritas. This is the place Tempe's Mucho Gusto wished it could be some day. But it probably won't.
neg	My brother also posted about our Mother's Day experience. These must be franchises because the Scottsdale and Chandler locations are like eating at a different restaurant entirely. This is the second and last time we will frequent this location. The pizza and calzones were awful.
pos	Very Hip Hotel and Comfortable ~ Amazing location ~Great Staff all is good at the Valley HO !!!
neg	Banfield is okay for routine check ups for maintenance and preventive care. That is why they offer a \"wellness plan\". When it comes to your animal getting sick I would go elsewhere. It should not be called a Hopital. The doctors are there for profit only and do not show any care for your pet. The vet techs care but the doctors don't listen to them. This place is lacking ethics when it comes down to making important decisions when it comes to your pets health.
pos	PCG is the restaurant by which I judge all others. PCG is totally dependable always excellent. Service is always good food excellent. i have eaten here probably 20 times and have never had a bad meal.   Although the food is not \"challenging\" in that there are no weird flavors or textures if you want a great nouvelle American meal for a reasonable amount of money you need look no farther than here.
neg	marginal sushi meets uncomfotable seating.  we used restaurant.com coupon and got stuck wtih an 18\% tip...with no service seriously???  felt scammed...think we actually spent more based on that tip than had we just paid full price.  avoid this one just not worth it.
pos	cant go wrong with a Double Double fries and a shake! Always good. Great service. I got some cold fries once called the corporate office they sent out some gift cards for our meals then followed up with a thank you card as well. Not to mention they sent a coupon in a Xmas card that year. You
neg	DO NOT GO HERE.  One of the worst restaurant experiences I have ever had.  The setup is a little like \"Pei Wei\" where they take your order give you a number and bring the food to your table.  Placed our order and had to stalk other tables and hover over people eating trying to wait to get a table.  Waited a long time all the while others who ordered after us found seats and got their food before us. Servers kept bringing my food to me since it was ready but I still didn't have a table so they kept saying they would \"put it under the heat lamp\" for me.  Finally eventually found a table and then kept waiting and waiting for our food which the manager claimed \"he had them remake\" since it was getting cold.  My food came and it was cold and disgusting.  We had to get going since we were going to a show and my mom's food still wasn't there.  The staff asked to see her receipt since they couldn't find her order.  She went up to the manager and said she just wanted her money back since we had to go (it had been 45 minutes since we placed our order).  He said her food would not be ready for a while and gave her some cash and we left.  My mom never even ate and my food was horrible.  I would NOT recommend this place it's awful.
pos	This place is very good.  I have dined here for breakfast lunch and dinner but Sunday brunch takes the cake.  Food is all extremely fresh and tasty.  The best time to go is when this place gets cranking the style is smaller portions of the food that have to be replaced very often when busy allowing for extremely fresh food.  Asian food is always good and the gentlemen behind the line can do custom stir fry for you.  Italian station has fresh pizzas that once again are made fresh for you or order a custom calzone like I do.  Mexican station always has the staples but recently had crab stuffed poblano rellenos!!!!  .  Berto's gelato with like 16 flavors is a great way to end your meal.  If you like buffets do yourself a favor and make this your number 1!!!
neg	Just isn't very good.  I don't understand why people give this place even three stars.  It's rare for me to give a place a low rating but My Big Fat Greek restaurant is nothing but gimmick anymore and has gone from bad to worse.   The food is not even close to any representation of what good Greek food tastes like.  I've been to this place several times over the years.  This location and others.   It used to be just on the lower end of OK...  it's never been as good as you can get from a 'Ma and 'Pa place.  However we went for lunch the other day and it's just gotten to the point I wouldn't even go back for a quick bite.  We ordered the garlic hummus and it was overly full of garlic and not home made.  It seemed to be loaded with garlic powder as opposed to fresh hummus that just had roasted garlic in it.   The olives we ordered were rough at best.  UGH even thinking about them.  Overly seasoned and not very fresh.   The rice was over cooked and was so soft it lacked any sort of texture.  The first rule of good let alone great food is FRESH.   This place needs a rescue.  Less critical but I think an overall representation of what has happened to the place the menu's were totally trashed.   As in ratty tattered and dirty.  The lamination was coming off them and they were dirty.   Do yourself a favor and go elsewhere.
pos	Pizza Venice has hands down the best pizza in the Valley. In my mind they've got the best bang for your buck with the XL three-topping pizza deal. Get that with the garlic crust and you're buying pizza nirvana. It doesn't hurt that the owners are incredibly friendly. Why would I even consider ordering terrible chain pizza when I can get a great pizza for a great price from a locally owned business?
neg	Slow unorganized and filled to the brim with crazy people. I prefer to do everything through the service arizona website but recently got a letter that I needed to get a new license because my picture was going to expire. It makes total sense that my license is valid until I'm 65 but the picture expires after 11 years. Of course the state charges a nominal fee of $12 to replace it. If the state of AZ was in need of my money I'd gladly just give it to them if it means avoiding this nightmare. Oh and the camera is set to fat...
pos	My son comes here for the tacos but I am all about the chile relleno.  I never had one with potatoes inside but oh my this was the best!  My only recommendation would be to order it dry with the sauce on the side.  I am counting the days until I get back to AZ.  The new location is so much closer to us I plan on trying all of their menu but....but... that chile relleno is ....calling....me.......! The tacos were very very good though.
neg	The service level and attitude of the staff was diabolical they demonstrated absolutely no interest in our business. Ever since moving to the new premises things have sucked. I shall not be wasting any more of my time or money here.
pos	I've learned to expect very little from airport restaurants.  Now I've been ruined - I went to Blanco and my paltry expectations were blown out of the water. Prompt and attentive service flavorful and delicious food and a delightful assortment of drink options.  I'll have to connect through Phoenix for the rest of my life.   I had the grilled shrimp salad which was fresh flavorful and filling. I also had the sangria which was pretty good. My friends had tacos (fish and carnitas); they practically licked their plates clean.  Try the rice - it is a rich and delectable treat.   An added bonus: They were patient as we sat for three hours waiting for our connecting flight. If I ever find myself in this airport again you can be sure I'll make my way here.
neg	I've been to Milano's Music several times and each experience is worse than the first time.  I look at the reviews of people I actually know and realize that each experience is different.  On the biggest day of the year for Small Business owners who should be reaching out to the customers and gladly sell them the smallest items Milano misses that point by miles.  My husband is re-learning to play the drums and needed a drummer's throne and since it was November 24th and \"Small Business Saturday\" I thought \"why not give them another try\" guess what we walked out with Nothing they lost potential set of drum customer  ( those can cost anywhere from a few $100 to $1k ).  I won't go back in there.  The guy that is in charge of the drum section is rude and pompous and walked away from us TWICE.  The second time was enough to make my blood boil.  We found a throne in another section that my husband liked and I said let's get it.  The guy came over and said \"Oh I have another one in the box\" and grabbed the one in my husband hands and walked off never to be seen again.  We waited and waited at the checkout counter for him to show up he never did because he had decided to help another couple.  I looked at the cashier and my husband and said \"NOT cool at all\" and my husband set all the other items he was going to purchase down and said we won't be purchasing anything.    I felt bad for the guy at the register because it wasn't his fault and he apologized but that doesn't give the guy running a section the right to decide what customer is more important and that is what he did.  New customers should never be treated any differently and to basically make a statement of you are not important enough was the final straw.    I grew up around Milano's music stores they were the first  to give me guitar lessons and it is sad to see this happy.  Besides this Yelp review  I plan to write their the store personally.  When small businesses are struggling and this kind of thing happens  a person begins to understand why more people shop with a big box store and less and less from Mom and pop stores.
pos	What a wonderful restaurant. I can't believe each dish is 475 calories or less and the portions are still a good size. No sauces no bread no fries. The fish tacos were delicious succulent with just the right amount of spiciness. The grilled boneless rainbow trout was fantastic. The pane seared sushi-grade Ahi Tuna salad was to die for. And leave room for dessert....yes dessert. Only $2.50 but arrives in a shot glass size bowl. just enough to stave off the sugar craving. The decor is elegant and sophisticated. Great for an executive power lunch or a date to impress. menu changes 4 times a year and features local fresh in 'season' food. Very inventive menu starting mainly around $9 (flatbreads and sandwiches) to $16 for lunch. Wait staff is knowledgeable and attentive. Great food great atmosphere great for your waist line. But even if you're not a calorie counter this still ranks right up there for the food quality taste and presentation.
neg	I have been a \"regular\" customer at this salon ever since it opened.  At first it was great!  Clean relaxing and welcoming.   After a few months without a manicure or pedicure I decide to treat myself to a manicure this past week.  I went in and a lady did a beautiful job on my gel manicure.  She paid attention to detail and didn't rush through the whole process.  I didn't have time to get a pedicure so I decided to come back the next day.  I only wish that I had her do my pedicure yesterday ...   The guy who did my pedicure had some sort of infection on his thumb.  I didn't notice it at first because he was using gloves but when it was time for the foot massage he took his gloves off revealing it.  Tracy was doing someone else's nails right in front of me and clearly saw that he had some sort of sore or fungus on his nail.  It was completely black and it looked like something was growing out of it.    I was shocked that she didn't tell him to at least put his gloves back on.  The \"massage\" that he gave me was hardly any massage at all.  He did the same motion over and over while concentrating on the tv.  Definitely not worth the $25.   The worst part is that he gave me an ingrown toe nail.  The whole right side of my nail is swollen and I just hope that I don't get an infection.  This was by far the worst pedicure that I have ever received. Even though I had a great gel manicure here my last experience was so horrible that I will not be back.
pos	Stopped in here for lunch today joined by Mike C. & Robyn N.  This was my third visit ever to a CB & the first time to this one.  I went with a Reuben Sandwich Plate which included a cup of Cole Slaw & a cup of Beefy Cabbage Soup.  The service was good at this location the atmosphere fun the food delicious & the prices reasonable.  5 Stars!     :-))  Reuben Sandwich Plate $8.19
neg	We were driving around Chandler area to find a decent place to eat and Mido Sushi caught our attention. \"Oh Okay!\" - I thought and walked right in. We were greeted right away with a good waitress but somehow I found her voice was really annoying! The food came out after 10minutes and I was disappointed with the sashimi! It wasn't as fresh as I expected. The soy sauce tasted very weird and too salty. By far this is not the most decent sushi restaurant I've experienced.  Kabuki and Masa sushi are still my best choice so far.
pos	I have not been bowling in 24 yearsso you can imagine i was worried. But this place is clean and fresh. On certain nights(Monday)and a few others you pay a $5.00 cover chargethen everything is $1.00 .Food drinks  games and most important bowling games. The instructions were easy. We got shoes in our size then went and picked out a ball. Lots to choose from! Lots of fun!!!   It was a $20.00 night for 2 of us. The workers are very helpful and Friendly. Bathrooms were also clean. I did not see them spray the shoes with Lysol so that was a little gross.But other than that it was a great time.
neg	My daughter and I went in for pedicures and gel sets... was incredibly surprised to hear the total was $120. even with a coupon!!! When I got home I noticed that my pedicure wasn't the best... I really don't mind paying top dollar for top dollar services but even with a 'coupon' it wasn't worth it. Won't be back...
pos	Maybe it was the authentic Gospel music in the background but our ears were filled with a heavenly chorus as we feasted upon the sacred and until this morning unknown pairing of chicken and waffles--a combination rivaled by only bread and wine in it's ability to induce a religious experience.
neg	Ok food. Super slow!! 3 employees and 2 customers and I could not believe how long it took for a quesadlla which was cold when I got it...the tacos were decent though....Give it a try and you decide though..
pos	If I were to ever get hooked on crack... I would want my crack to be these amazing donuts! They are delicious and addicting.
neg	I went for family birthday on a Friday night. Only a few people in dining room eating. (1st clue to leave.) Ordered a margarita. It's extra to have it shaken... But I ordered that way. It was mostly sour mix. An it was awful (How do you mess up a margarita?(2nd clue to leave) Server is surprised we wanted to order dinner! (3rd clue to run!) Very disappointing. I got the chicken fajitas they had sauce all over them. Shrimp appetizer consists of 3 shrimp $8. Salsa was good.  I will never go back. Good luck Salty. I love your decor. Why don't you care you could be so cool!
pos	Best donuts I have ever had.
neg	I wish I could review the cold food stand attached to this restaurant separately because I want to tell any and all persons who think to stop by for quick sandwich to stay far far away from the tuna.   I thought nothing was worse than slowly starving on my flight back home but I found it in the form of this cold barely-recognizable-as-food sandwich. I think I'd prefer eating tuna out of the can over this.
pos	Considering my experience with a previous dentist I was hesitant to try a new one. But my experience was absolutely the best.  Foothills Smiles is the best dentist I have been to in the valley!! They are professional friendly and reassuring allowing their patients to feel comfortable during the visit.  Most people dread going to the dentist but I feel motivated to continue going to my 6 month check-ups!!
neg	My love affair with Fate ended when Johnny left.   The service quality and atmosphere took a total nose dive.  Go to Sens instead.
pos	Vitality Health and Fitness is a small gym that offers personal fitness group fitness and fitness classes. The classes and the training programs are all varied challenging unique and fun. The members are positive full of smiles and easy-going. The gym is not intimidating at all the trainers are kind and build programs that suit your personal fitness levels and the cost is VERY reasonable.    My husband and I have been working out with Megan and she's a doll.  We haven't gone for very long so we'll keep you posted on the impending RESULTS!  Vitality also offers nutrition and massage -- which we both plan on checking out!  The owner is delightful and easy to work with. If you have any questions or concerns about your costs or the way you are being treated she works WITH you to ensure you are getting the level of service that you expect and that the club/program can provide. The owner is honest and respectful fair and reasonable. I think everyone should contact this club and see if it might work for them - you won't be disappointed!
neg	Be VERY VERY careful asking for a sandwich as a wrap. I ordered a ham and cheese make your own sandwich ordered it as a wrap to go. I got home there's lettuce and mayo and... what this? what's this I see in this sandwich? there's the cut-off fingertip of someone's glove lodged between the lettuce? (At least I hope it's the finger tip of a glove - I'm not even going to think of the other thing it could have been.) Ewwww.... gross.... I didn't finish the sandwich. Memo to self: Don't ever get wraps from Einstein's particularly not the one on Shea. Disgusting. If it ever happens again I'm calling a local news station to report it then I'll call the state health department. Gross gross gross gross gross gross... if you can't deliver sanitary wraps THEN DON'T PUT THEM ON THE MENU. Not a place to go if you like wraps.
pos	After 6 years of searching I have finally found Laura!  My brows have never really been \"bad\" per se but not great either...I have been searching for someone to show me the hidden potential of my natural arches and Laura did just that.  After only two visits she has groomed my brows into perfect shape and balance. Its funny how such a small change can make such a big difference!   I also enjoy the quiet and private suite with the pretty chandelier to look at during my appointments...and she always has great music playing in the background too!  Thanks Laura!
neg	I give this review a total 1 star If I was able to I would have rated no stars at all!.... I would NEVER reccomend ANYONE to live here. The office staff is horrible and made me feel uncomfortable the whole year I lived there based on THEIR MISTAKES! I can not express how disappointed I am with the way that they have treated me.....
pos	Just the facts re: full dinner experience:  Ambiance: Thinking about redecorating the house to look just like Trader Vic's - unbelievable. Service: perfectly charming informative and attentive. Drinks: I don't drink so read every other review for a review of drinks. Appetizer: Beef Cho-Cho - amazingly tender it melts in your mouth. Great flavor. Dinner: Trader Vic's Calcutta Curries: good & better when you mix in the variety of garnishes.  fun to play around with the flavors. Dinner 2: Chinese BBQ Flat Iron Steak: Amazing.  Crispy onions mashed potatoes and tender/flavorful steak will make you close your eyes and wish it would never end. Dessert: (don't know the name) vanilla icecream covered in coconut  on a bed of chocolate sauce: simple beautiful and tasty.   Overall experience: the best darn dinner experience I've ever had.
neg	Remember how I said that the Trivia was the best thing about this place?  Well they got rid of long time Triva host Dave (who had been featured in the College Times and was the best thing about the trivia).  Without Dave's personality this place just doesn't cut it.  Will never go here again. Bummer.
pos	Great Mom/Pop store! We've stopped by several times for some fresh produce and to get treats for the kids. We usually sit outside on one of tha picnic tables to eat gelato while the kids love playing/petting all the animals. Thanks!
neg	Had some time to kill before the Ultimate pleY Date Yelp event and I'd wanted to share my love of Nobuo's Dark chocolate mousse with green tea ice cream and sugared orange peels with my happy-go-lucky cousin who has never been here before so we stopped by at 5:17p to find that Nobuo wouldn't open till 5:30p so we waited outside in the comfortable patio.  After watching a couple of employees add lanterns to their outdoor umbrellaed tables I noticed the \"OPEN\" sign on the front door so we entered the resto whereupon we were greeted warmly by a male host and shown to a two-top.  I didn't like the energy in that room so I asked if we could sit elsewhere and he said to choose wherever we wanted to sit.  We were the first customers so we chose a four-top knowing we wouldn't be taking up space for very long anyway.  Glasses of water were delivered and soon we met our female server (whose name on the receipt reflected \"Butai\").  When she laid down the menus I told her we would only be having dessert and could we see the dessert menu?  I wished we had a video of the look she gave us a look of pure distaste as she gathered up the dinner and beverage menus and said \"We don't have dessert menus as we only have two...\" and proceeded to tell us of the mousse and the almond-orange fritters.  She walked away and as we loudly discussed about our losing our interest in dining there she came back with napkins and utensils and asked if we decided what we were going to have.  I decided to forgo our server's very cold treatment and asked for the mousse.  After all I'd already finished a glass of ice-cold water and cousin's phone needed recharging...    When Butai placed our chocolate mousse http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/0Buxoc0cRqjpvkezo3bqog?select=rK8m1rxl50PB69_c2YqQTg#rK8m1rxl50PB69_c2YqQTg on the table I wanted to send it back.  Where was the lovely bowl and presentation of the last dessert I had here?  Was she serious in presenting us with this stale-looking mousse with cracked edges and whose green tea ice cream had ice crystals on it?  I don't know about you but the only times I've seen crystals on ice cream is when it has slightly melted and placed back in the freezer to re-freeze.  For me seeing crystals on ice cream is a sign that it is old...  I brought the receptacle and showed it to the male host who assured me that all of the mousse is made daily at 4:00a and seeing cracks and bubbles in the mousse is normal so I decided we would go ahead and try it if for nothing else but to have something to report here.  The dessert was definitely not up to par with the pretty bowl http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/0Buxoc0cRqjpvkezo3bqog?select=o9jIksB-MObhCxoI_msekQ#o9jIksB-MObhCxoI_msekQ I had during our October OYE in taste and presentation but it was OK.  The mousse was still cold and stiff and it had a mouth-feel more of like thick chocolate ganache filling/icing on a cake- certainly not the silky-smooth chocolate decadence I knew it could be.  My cousin had to warm up to the dish as the sound of chocolate and green tea together didn't seem like a great combo to her (I told her to trust me).  She also never enjoyed orange and chocolate together but she liked it in this dessert.    I understand that the knowledge of having to serve only dessert instead of dinner AND dessert which translates to a higher table bill can be a bit of a disappointment but why must you show your displeasure to your guests?  Butai you were lucky that my cousin even left you the change for a tip- she didn't want to give you anything and you certainly didn't deserve it!  When I told other Yelp friends about the sub-par service and dessert we just had one replied she didn't enjoy the last time we had apps here (I think it was around Halloween and First Friday?) either.  Cousin and I thought it very poor taste that our server gave us that awful condescending look after finding out we were just going to have dessert; We didn't deserve that!  I am never going to recommend Nobuo to anyone anymore.  I even promised my Japanese friend (who lives and works overseas) I'd treat her to a dining experience here when she comes to visit.  Guess I'll have to find another place to take her...  I don't want to risk getting the same treatment from Butai or from another server should we come back here.    Sorry Nobuo but I won't be returning.
pos	I went for brow threading.  Yelena was extremely gentle and took her time making sure they were perfect!  I just found my new \"brow lady\" and she's just across the street from my office! LOVE IT!!!  Give her a try!
neg	Living in this area I frequent Desert Ridge a lot and have been to this Macaroni Grill several times... their food is actually pretty good which is why I let the horrible service slide a few times... My friend and I have had experiences such as standing at the host stand with no assistance for several minutes while several employees made eye contact. Of course no one asked if we had been helped until the hostess finally made her way back up to the stand and decided to ignore us for another couple of seconds before she even acknowledged us.   Another visit we were seated right away however it took over 15 minutes for our server to come to our table and that was only after I had to get out of my seat and find one of the employees to ask for our server. I know several people saw us just sitting there the least they could have done was asked if we had been helped or not.   This last experience was about a year after the last. I thought maybe they would have changed. I most definitely thought wrong! We were seated promptly and the server was there right away this time. However our food took FOREVER! Literally it took over 30 minutes for a medium rare steak and a plate of pasta. I know for a fact they messed something up and ended up taking food out of a to go container and placing it on the plate that they then brought to me (you can see right into their kitchen from the dining room). The server never apologized nor did she come and tell us what the hold up was.   Overall I will never go to that restaurant again.
pos	This is my go-to spot for mani-pedi's and brow waxing. They do a bang-up job on my poor feet because it takes a lot to get those pups looking good. I have never made an appointment but never had to wait more that 3-5 minutes to be assigned a nail tech.  They recently got new massage chairs that don't grind your bones or shake you to death like some chairs do. Also this is one of the best places I have been for a brow wax. My sensitive skin has taken a beating at many other places but never here. I don't know anyone by name but the employees are all very nice and skilled at what they do. Oh and they are typically $5 cheaper than anywhere else I have been for pedicures!
neg	I love Mexican food. Today I ate half of a taco and simply had to stop; not in a good way either. The meat tasted like it had been frozen multiple times and lacked flavor. The tortilla tasted like it was store bought and made of paper. The beans were flavorless. The rice was hard and lacked any flavor. Moving to the vegetables: shredded plastic is not actually a vegtable. This is some of the worst tasting most over priced Mexican food I had had. It would be one thing if it was reasonably priced but $10 for taco is a absurd amount for a worst than fast-food taste.   The margarita was good but $10 for a margarita is a bit on the high side.  The service was average but I found it odd that my waitress didn't find it odd that only a bite of each item was missing and never asked how the food tasted.
pos	In Phoenix for a concert and felt like Thai. Found this place on Yelp! and decided to check it out based on the reviews and the fact that it was near the friend we were visiting at the time. The restaurant is in a strip shopping center that we never would have noticed (or found) had we not been looking for it. Oh but what a magical dining experience! The cashew chicken was the best I'd ever had (and we eat Thai a LOT!) and the chicken satay was exceptional. Loved the veggie Pad Thai and my husband got a vegetarian (tofu) curry dish he loved. Wish this place wasn't 400 miles from my house. I'd be eating here every week!
neg	The food was not particularly good on our last visit there and the service was rude and not helpful at all.  I even emailed them afterwards to give feedback in hopes that they would redeem themselves by showing some good service that way.  No luck.  Didn't even get a response.  They will not be getting any more of my business.  Too bad because I'd actually had a decent mushroom burger there before and would have been a regular customer.  But the service last time was so bad that I won't go back.
pos	No attitude efficient lines clean well stocked with flat rate boxes and other sundries????? Is this USPS or a dream?   Writing Yelp reviews for post offices seems like... weird or something but it feels so right for this location.
neg	I went there with a friend last year after reading so many good reviews. The service is good. We didn't have to wait but I didn't like the food I ordered. I had a salmon with caper butter sauce. The fish is not fresh at all and the food is too geasy for me.
pos	Satori to Kaigen! (Enlightenment and Spiritual Awakening!)  1st review.  Nervous and working on an empty stomach with the only exception being the half loaf of French bread and herb-butter I had consumed prior to dinner. Thinking Asian all day and being an incapable decision maker I rely on Yelp and the assistance of a small list and a single 6 sided cube with dots on it.  I jotted down 6 prominent businesses held my breath and flicked a wrist.  A \"2\" brought me to La's Thai Cuisine!  Peeped the website and open til 9:30 score! My eye spotted closing time was at 9:00 though!  Arriving on the scene at 8:49 poorly reverse parking my Honda in two spots because I was worried that they were closed.  They weren't I was met by a Thai beauty introducing herself as Lisa.  I humbly asked for takeout my adventure begins with the opening door...  Smells are incredible.  Having thought they were closed I had forgotten what I was going to order! I rifled through the menu feeling as if the whole kitchen was watching (they weren't) but she instructed me to take my time; So I ordered a soup a salad an entree a dessert and a side of brown rice. They kindly ask me for my preference on the degree of heat on each item I asked for not the hottest but close to the top.  #17  Mixed Vegetable Soup: Stellar  Culinary Thought: Clear piping spicy and vegetable packed.   Ninja Eating Plan: Gently lay over white and brown rice alternately.   # 9   Papaya Salad (Som-Tum): Phenomenal  Culinary Thought: I got shrimp on the side due to allergies.  This was probably the most awesome experience of the evening.  They even \"fenced in\" the shrimp within a Masai-esqe cage of cabbage to prevent their oceanic brine from invading the delicate papaya sprout and carrot forest. Spice and crunch with every munch. Beautiful.  Ninja Eating Plan: Try not to be seen scarfing this down in front of a date it's that awesome. Fortunately my sister was only present and she knows I can eat like a pig and sound like one too.   # 53 Peanut Curry (Panang curry style comes with rice!): Umami  Culinary Thought: I don't like coconut. I do now. The lemon and coconut milk rises through the savory peanut curry.  Tofu was my protein option it was done perfectly.  Green beans provided great consistency in this masterful crescendo.  Ninja Eating Plan: Laid over rice alternately brown and white rice interrupted by the occasional gorgeous curry-only spoonful.     Coconut Ice Cream: Yum  Culinary Thought: I was reeling at this point but I wanted to continue this experience.  As I stated earlier coconut is not my thing but I believe in giving things a fair try so I did.  Coconut ice cream is delicious. Coconut pulp or meat I still have a texture issue with but the honey swirl throughout the ice cream made this delectable.  Ninja Eating Plan: Use the cooling ice cream energy to return your body back to normalcy. Perfect coda for the culinary symphony.  I will be back.  I plan to have every dish vegetarian style.  Family-run places are truly number 1.    Overall experience of the Culinary Ninja: PAVLOV  Do you hear the sound of a bell chiming?
neg	Hot fudge Sunday was watered down so much. You would do much better by going to mcdonalds. This isn't the first time. I should quit giving this place chances. I'm disappointed every time. I once asked for hot fudge on the bottom of my sundae and was charged $2.60 more. The staff is rarely friendly. They should consider being friendly since it IS Dairy Queen a place that takes many of us back to our childhoods. The array of desserts are so wonderful why not serve them wonderfully and with a smile and not like you hate your job and just want to go home?
pos	I went to the physical location the first time with my dog Foxy to scope out the place.  The store inside is iitttyyy bitttyyy and not worth going to in all honesty but the staff that work there are REALLY friendly and helpful.  Foxy eats Evanger's which is really hard to find and the only place I knew of that carried it was 20min away from me.       A month later I run out of dog food....so I call Goober (after research I find they sell Evanger's for the cheapest price) and they delivered it right to me.  I wasn't home so they left it on my front porch along with a pretty large amount of free dog treats for Foxy !  They left their newsletter some reference cards and their product list (which is HUUUUGGGEEE) in a bag hanging from my door.  The reference cards you give out will earn you discounts on your next purchase!  Oh of course- I forgot to mention the delivery was completely FREE of charge!!!  I'll never get my dog food anywhere else.
neg	What a crap airline!  If I could give them zero stars I would.  I flew from Phoenix to Denver to New Orleans.  The check-in people gate staff and flight attendants were rude and abrupt the flights ALL left at least 45 minutes late it was the worst flying experience I've had.  I was fortunate thta my Denver back to Phoenix leg was US Airways...never thought I'd say \"Thank you US Airwarys\" for at least that part of the flight not being a nightmare!  I will never fly United again!
pos	So yummy!! My favorite Mexican place!! Love the chips salsa and bean dip. The extra spicy green salsa is so good too. We are regulars here.
neg	If I could give zero stars I would.  I have never spent more time looking for a bar than I have looking for this. And not like a cool underground dance club in L.A.  When we finally found this sh*thole sandwiched between two vacant businesses it was barely visible.  The sign for it looked like it was written with a sharpie on a piece of cardboard and someone duct tapped a flashlight to it.  Before we even entered the bar as my friend and I were walking up two redneck bikers whispered \"Fags\" as we walked by them.  I don't think these were the kind of guys you argued with so I let it go.  When we entered the bar I noticed several \"No firearms\" signs plastered on the walls.  I'm assuming they've had a problem with this before.  Remember that scene in the Blues Brothers where they go to the country bar and get the look of death from the patrons?  That's how I felt.  The decor of this bar was interesting.  It looked as if they got the tables and chairs from an old 70s Vegas casino.  The place is about the size of a small apartment's living room so getting a seat is pretty much impossible.  We went to the bar to do some karaoke but apparently they also sell crappy jewelry for some reason?  Weird.  I've also never heard so much cussing from karaoke singers.  One of the drunken hicks actually got into a shouting match with one of the morbidly obese toothless tattooed bicker chicks where they argued who was the bitch and who was the pussy.  Halfway through my beer my friends showed up and they refused to go inside so I ran away and never looked back.  TIP: If you go here wear a black leather jacket bandana and Harley Davidson gear.
pos	I have been taking vehicles to this place for 15+ years mostly for routine maintenance but occasionally for the other annoying things your car does to you. We have never had any problems with their service or repairs and they have always been reasonably priced fair and honest with us.  They also refill propane tanks.  Note -- this business has outlasted at least two gas suppliers. Previous names include McClintock Unocal and McClintock 76 :-)
neg	Everytime I have gone in this store I have left feeling like a big pile of poop. The staff is sooo horrible. I read the other reviews and it seems to be a common thing which really sucks because I would probably shop here a lot more if the staff wasn't a bunch of pricks. P.S. I found a skirt at Target for $10 that is EXACTLY like one they carry except they want $40 dollars and your soul.
pos	Thank you Sunflower for having a decent selection of tofu and fake meats so I don't have to drive 25 minutes to Whole Foods. Also I would like to tell you that I really enjoy your produce prices and your friendly staff especially the cashiers they are always so pleasant and helpful. While I am at it I should probably apologize for \"sampling\" lots of your candy from the bulk item bins those chocolate covered peanut butter filled pretzels are amazing I promise I always use the scoop. And one more thing it's really awesome that you carry beers brewed by Rinkukiu Alaus Darykla the Lobster Lover is DELICIOUS!
neg	Sadly I'm giving this place one star and an explanation why it is only getting one star.  The Manger/operator guy.  Sure the food here isn't all that bad.  Probably a half a notch or so higher than most of the hot slop fast food you can get for lunch.  Most of the crew members are pretty attentive don't seem to be meth addicted and I see them cleaning the tables on a regular basis.  Looks like the crew changes over quite often and I know why.  My beef is not with the crew members oh no.  Not with the food or cleanliness of the store.  Nope.  The Manager guy the guy who looks like a real pussy version of John Leguizamo.  This guy ruins about every trip I have to this joint.  That is my problem with this joint.  Elaboration will proceed now.  This guy is without a doubt one of the biggest assholes I have ever encountered in the fast food industry.  Actually one of the biggest assholes period.  What a douche bag.  Seems like any time I have a coupon this guy will literally butt in the middle of the order give me a ration of shit and do about anything possible not to use it.  Seriously what is it 30 cents?  I had a store coupon that was on a tray liner a while ago and this nutsack got in the middle of the order cancelled it and refused to let the coupon be used.  I asked why and he said it was not legit (why was it on the tray liner then fuckhead?) I checked the menu they would have lost 10 cents.  Lady taking my order after P.J.L. (pussy John Leguizamo) walked away pretty embarassed said \"sorry\"  Not her fault.  Never saw her working there after then was probably tired of that guys shit.  I don't blame you.  Last trip here they have promos on their drink cups for free shit.  Awesome.  We all know this is the garbage that costs them nothing but I am a sucker for something free.  On my trip before the last I got one for a free corndog.  SCORE!  I cash it in on my last trip and the guy ringing up the order said it would be on a different ticket.  No sweat I could give a shit less as long as I get my corndog.  Go to get my order ask where the corndog is.  P.J.L. butts in the middle of the order says \"This is your order this is what you have\" and was a fucking prick about it.  Me the customer.  Yanks the receipt out of my hand gives me an attitude about it.  Who the fuck talks to a customer like that even at a low rent fast food joint?  Fuck you.  Seriously.  The guy who took my order tried to explain the situation and dicknose literally looks at him puts his hand in front of the guys face and says \"ssssshhhhhh\" and snaps his fingers the same way I do to my dogs to keep them barking or eating drywall.  Who degrades their employees like that?  All he was trying to do was explain my free item was on another ticket.  Instead of listening he made a complete asshat out of himself.  It was a corndog what does that cost you anyway about 12 cents in batter a stick and a combination of horse eyeballs and badger penis meat?    Dude (cashier guy tattoo on your arm) tell that guy to get fucked and get a better job.  No one deserves that shit.  I am actually ashamed I didn't say something for you I truly am.  What would have normally gotten a decent review is what it is.  My rant speaks for itself.  One shithead ruins it for the ones working for him.  For the ones working there I will pray for you.  You need it.  P.J.L. get out of there and become a pimp in Tijuana they need midget controlling assholes over there.  You would do great at that.
pos	Private Karaoke at Geisha A Go Go is the coolest thing to hit Old Town in a while!!   My girlfriends and I went this weekend and it was incredible. I have heard a lot about karaoke being the new trend but not until I actually experienced it for myself did I understand why until now. We had a private room with a flat screen TV and drinks at the flip of a switch (um can you say bachelorette party?!).  It was so nice to have a night out without actually having to wait for drinks at a crowded bar or being able to hang out with your friends without random guys interrupting with a cheesy line to try to talk to you. It was $75 for an hour in a private room with 10 of my best friends. And by the time you split that between everyone it was well worth the extra expense.   Seriously once you try it you will be hooked too! I can't wait to go back!
neg	Tried to eat here Friday night for the seafood buffet. We waited in line for 90 minutes before finally giving up. Would have been much sooner but the drive down there from my house is almost an hour.   They have three lines tiered based on the level of player's club card. The diamond card holders waltzed right in and the hostesses would seat from that line until it was empty before anyone from the 'lesser' lines would be seated. At the end we stood still... didn't move an inch... for 20 minutes. So no-one from our line was seated for 20 minutes while dozens of people waltzed right through in the diamond and platinum lines.   What a fucking joke. Waster my whole evening trekking down there dreaming of crab legs just to be snubbed by them.  Never EVER again.
pos	Yes it's on the Northwest side and its tucked into a non-descript strip mall better known for being the home of Padre Murphy's Sports Bar but don't let appearances fool you this is a great gym. The gym offers a large selection of cardio equipment weight machines free weights and group exercise classes. It also has a pool hot tub sauna and steam room. But will really makes this gym special is its kids care facility. It has video games pop-a-shot and a giant climbing structure that my kids like so much they are begging to go to the gym... and it's a lot easier to get a workout done when the kids are excited about going!  Definitely a great find and well worth the drive to the Northwest side.
neg	Angry Bro Bar !  Please go here if you wear size smedium affliction shirts you will love it. The bar is lame. Kid you not there was not five minutes that went by where two people didn't try and fight each other.
pos	What a brewpub should be.  The beers are great. The food the Slingers (wow) & the service is all top rate.  Lisa the server was very helpfull. I need say no more.
neg	Gross repulsive appauling disgusting overrated dirty should be shut down by the CDC.  You get the jist?
pos	Brookstone is the Sharper Image's older and more laid back cousin.  Yea it's got a similar feeling but it's more focused on keeping you relaxed and healthy than on funky electronic toys.  The massaging chairs pads and other devices are enough motivation to stop in alone.  And if you're with a partner who's less interested than shopping it's a great place for them to just hang out too!  (Trust me - this works.)
neg	The guy who worked the front door Sunday night deserves to be fired.   Sound harsh?   Not at all. Had a supervisor overheard how he treated my friend he would have agreed.  We pull up in the car.  It looks fine from the outside so we send in one of the five of us in to scope it out (check the menu see if there's seating etc). Normal behavior.    So my friend K approaches the guy at the door and asks \"what type of food is served here?\" expecting a simple response like  \"American\" or \"here let me grab you a menu.\"  Ready for this...??   His response: \"human food\"  HUMAN FOOD?!?!?!  HUMAN FOOD!??!?!  K is just an average potential customer asking a fair easy to answer question.  Okaaaaay. Being the sweetheart K is she goes with it (it: him being a meeeeeanie) and asks if there is outdoor seating.  He sarcastically mockingly and and outright D-bagly points out how there is a seat yourself sign right nearby.   How was this guy ever hired?  Again a more appropriate responds (TOOL:) would have been \"yea the patio seems like it has some space tonight AND I'D BE HAPPY TO GO CHECK FOR YOU\" or \"at this fine establishment it's seat yourself but usually the outside turns over quickly.\"  Sunday night's fine joke machine at the front door: I could happily give you several other decent responses you could have said to an innocent patron.  Everyone and their mom has had some turn at being a waiter/hostess/manager/bartender etc etc in the food and hospitality industry be it in AZ SF WHEREVER and KNOWS the #1 101 rule is:   BE KIND TO THE GUEST (kiss@$$  the customer is always right etc.)   Add to that list: answer straightforward questions from your guests with flat out non-acrimonious answers!  Granted this review can say nothing about this establishement beyond the front door because we never made it that far.
pos	There is no shortage of Mexican restaurants in AZ and this one is one of the tops on my list.  It's not your average Mexican fast food.  It's a little more pricey but well worth it.  Their bean and cheese burrito is so good (they say no lard and I don't know what else they use to make it good).  Their carne asada and pastor tacos are done to perfection.  I stop by whenever I pass by this place.
neg	I went here while on vacation visiting my friend. Neither of us had been there before but I know they have lots of locations on the west coast so we gave it a try.   The staff was totally rude. Before we went we called to check the hours. The guy on the phone was patronizing and acted inconvenienced to have to give any information.   The pizza was blah - totally generic and nothing special. If you're going to have mediocre food you better have exceptional service. Double fail.
pos	I have been to this place many times and the food and service is always great. I am so excited to have found a place where I can get freshly made good food out here in Queen Creek. My favorite is their home made mozzarella cheese. Its great on anything. I frequently order the tomato basil and Mozzarella pizza and I recently discovered their vegetarian plate which was delicious. The staff is very friendly and the atmosphere is casual and comfortable. Don't forget to save room for the amazing ice cream they have.
neg	This review is for the bar only. I had a date last week and was looking for a local bar to grab drinks at. I called Cycle on Wednesday and was told they would be open until at least midnight on Friday and the guy was very nice. Friday arrives and I take my date there and when we enter the bar the bartender makes a gas face and says they are closed for the night. I told her that I called just two days earlier and she just stared at me. No attempt at fixing anything nada. One drunken patron at the bar yelled to open the bar back up but I was over it. Well done cycle.
pos	Stayed here for the RocknRoll marathon like 80\% of the guests and absolutely enjoyed my stay.  the hallways to the rooms were the only slightly blah decor all other things such as the bedrooms bathroom lobby restaurant and pools were great!  Amenities included: 1. pet fish (that someone else fed) 2. complimentary granola for the race day 3. smores for our firepit (next to the pool) 4. nice wait-staff that was pleasant and chatted us up 5. super fast towel replenishment service (4 girls use up a lot of towels) 6. great cabanas -we never had a problem snagging one or two of them 7. happy hour decent food delicious alcohol... 8. cool lobby area with lots of places to looooounge at 9. dog friendly 10. heated pools  love it!  I will stay here again for sure..
neg	This place is a freaking joke. Expect an overcrowded waiting room and at minimum an hour wait. They see children but there is nothing in the waiting room to entertain them so they are all screaming and crying. There's not even room for a stroller. Horrible horrible experience!
pos	This is one of my favorite places to take out of town guests.  It never fails that we laugh so hard our sides hurt!  Always fresh always funny!  Great place for a date night or family night!  Even my teenagers love it!  I never have to worry about offending my guests because their content is family friendly.    To finish off the night head down the street to \"The Sugar Bowl\" for fresh ice cream!
neg	Huge line for incompetent employees who don't even know how to wash cars.
pos	I was very sad to see this restaurant go. I wish Anthony the best and hope he opens up somewhere else!
neg	Really as bad as it gets. Crap food. Over priced. Ugly tasteless interior Bad music and music system Tired staff This place needs to either have a complete redo or it needs to close.  I would rather go down the street and eat at Applebee's and I have never been to an Applebee's. Too many other choices now in the neighborhood for this place to go on in its present condition. Then again there might be enough people around these parts with really bad taste to keep the place going.
pos	Excellent Soutwest breakfast bowl.  Great service.  Very convenient to downtown hotels.
neg	I wish they had a \"0\" star option too!  The service and food was awful. Just a bunch of kids running the place.  The place closes at 10pm but when we went in there at 8pm all the workers were too busy cleaning to go home early to help us.  The food was burnt  on one side and raw on the other. The manager was too busy flirting with the other help. We couldn't get drinks because all the glasses where dirty we were told by our waitress. We asked for the manager before we left at 8:45 and was told he already went home for the evening. What kind of manager leaves a bunch of teenager to run the place?   NEVER GOING BACK!!!!
pos	I can't help but love this place. I've been going here since quite literally the day the opened. I move further away and I keep coming back.  The staff is friendly the food is delicious the beer selection constantly rotates to new and interesting beers... and this is basically the de-facto hangout for climbers and cyclists! Really can't go wrong with this place.
neg	Good service but the food was horrific. The pollo fundido was dry & no flavor.  Could not eat the tamale it was so bad. Will not go back. I had better Mexican off the neighborhood roach coach.
pos	I went to Peter Piper Pizza tonight to celebrate my daughter's 5th birthday! It is a great place for kids to have fun. Being a former employee of PPP I know that we could have had reservations for her birthday and had a party representative help with everything. Unfortunately this was just a small family celebration. So I ordered the big family meal deal which consisted of two large pizzas and an order of wings. The pizza is always delicious to me it is not greasy like some of the pizza places out there. We forgot to bring a lighter for the birthday candle so they had one on hand for us to borrow. Needless to say this is a place that the kids love. They can eat great pizza & play which is all kids worry about.
neg	I was accused of training my wife for compensation and was told to leave the gym or he (Page the trainer) was going to call the cops.  I don't know how a trainer confuses me working WITH my wife with training my wife for compensation.    Management handled this issue horribly.   Their lack of attention to the matter showed exactly what a customer of 6 years was worth.   You are treated only as a number.  Do yourself a favor and stay away.  I have since started going to a gym which is much more expensive but worth every penny to be treated with respect.
pos	I would not survive without Channel 8. i really don't watch much TV but when I do I want it to count.  Let me see: Keeping Up Appearances Coupling RedDwarf Antiques Roadshow NewsHour Nova This Old House Dr. Wayne Dyer Frontline Horizon Scientific American Frontiers The War As Time Goes By Red Green. Plus tons of responsible programming for kids in the am and afternoon.  (I don't think RedDwarf and Coupling air on PBS anymore - but thanks to PBS for introducing me)
neg	OMG! I am so frustrated at this store I have never met such an incompetent group of people in my entire shopping life.   First I called Fry's Electronics to check to see if they had a specific GPS model that worked in Europe. I called because I live at 115th Ave and Buckeye which is about 20miles from the nearest store. The call center informed me they did not carry that model but listed about 10 other GPS with maps of Europe. I asked again those models have maps of Europe? \"Yes and Australia too\". And you have those models in stock? \"Yes.\" What is the price range? \"$100 to $300\". Thank you. FIRST MISINFORMATION!   So I drove to  30th Ave and Thunderbird talked with \"GPS Specialist\" (which apparently means nothing) and he (Jared) informed me they did not have any GPS units with European maps!! He said the call center \"is a bunch of retards\" and that those were all last years models.   Then he called someone and looked at several GPS Units. When he did not know  if the unit had European maps or not he GOOGLED them! (okay not confident in your product knowledge). Then he sold me a $260 unit with European maps. SECOND MISINFORMATION.   I drove all the way home and the GPS did not have European maps! I had to buy them for another $100 which I could have done with a cheaper GPS.  So I drive back to Fry's. Speak with a Supervisor they return my first GPS. I speak with the same sales rep (ya thats great). He says he figured out 25min after I left that he sold me the wrong product and none of their GPS have european maps.   So I then buy the cheapest model that was could download European maps according the the sales rep Garmin NUVI 50Lm for $129.  THIRD MISINFORMATION. Because according to the Garmin site the NUVI 40Lm is also compatible and cheaper.   I then went home bought the $100 European map and couldn't download it to my GPS because there wasn't enough space available!!!  Now I have to buy a miniSD Card and a miniSD reader for my Mac book. Awesome. Great to know that the electronic store knows nothing about electronics!
pos	I had the Crispy Steelhead and it was delicious! The sweet pea risotto and roasted tomato-chanterelle ragout were a great addition. If you're looking for a great restaurant with an original menu this is the place to go! Friendly staff and they were quick to seat us.
neg	WOW!  I have never been to a place with service this horrible.  I may have caught them on a bad night but I'm not giving them a second chance to find out!  I came in with a group of 4.  We stood up front for 5-10 minutes before waving someone down to be seated.  That was a mistake..  As we're waiting for a server to take our drink order we noticed that EVERY single table had empty cups waiting to be refilled dirty plates that needed bussing and people with impatient faces.  There was only 1-2 dedicated servers and they completely ignored us.  We stuck around just to see how long it would take before someone took our drink order it was like being in the Twilight Zone.  After 30 minutes and flagging down 3 employees we just walked out laughing no one had even apologized for the wait I'm not sure they even saw us leave!  It was the strangest restaurant experience of my life.  What a joke...  **EDIT**  To their credit right after I posted this review I received a message explaining that the Director of Operations would like to amend the situation even going so far as to include their cell number.  I admit that I feel strange posting such a negative statement amid all the 4 and 5 star reviews I'm assuming I caught them on a really bad night.  I'll edit this if I ever return to the restaurant but the fact that someone actually reached out to try to rectify things says something
pos	Fantastic donuts! Great selection! Coffee was definitely above average!
neg	I've decided to completely write this place off and here is why you should too:  THREE TIMES I have tried to go here and they have been closed all the while their website and posted hours say they should be open. If one of you wants to drive all the way here from the suburbs you'd better call first because this place cannot be trusted. I've wasted my time and spent hungry minutes walking here only to be disappointed.   Vitamin T will fail there I said it.
pos	I have been here a few times but have to remember to come here more often.   I LOVE it!   I've never made it past the refrigerated and prepared foods section but who needs to! You can find everything you need right there.   The meat section is beautiful to look at they have a whole section of prepared heat and eat dinners side soups sauces etc. grab a premade one or grab a few ingredients and make your own!   My favorite so far would be the Tub of Alfredo sauce package of fresh pasta and package of chicken breast strips ..YUM!  Dinner in 20 anyone? ;-)  Their Tomato basil soup is Amazing too!!   I scored dinner for 3 last night for ......$7!!!!  2 packages of their heat and eat mac and cheese and 2 packages of Tilapia all ready and in about 10 minutes!   Seriously if you are trying to save money and still want to eat good fresh and easy food then this your place!
neg	There were 3 cars in the parking lot and people walking to the door but the young lady closed the doors at 9:51pm  The young lady spoke through the glass for atleast 4 minutes explaining she would not open the doors  I live behind this location but I may not return. There is a Walgreens off of 7th Street...
pos	So I now frequent The Vig.  If you go talk to Jason the bartender.  He's quick with the beverages and funny.  Enjoy yourself.  You deserve it!  This place can get packed during dinner hour though.
neg	I am writing this review only for the optical department. I accidentally poked my eye with a branch yesterday and knew I had damaged it so I went to the Gilbert Costco optician and asked if I could be seeing on an emergency basis. The receptionist asked me if I could come back in 5 hours to which I stated it was an emergency and could asked the Dr if she could see me. She asked her and she said no she did not have time. I find it very unbelievable that on an emergency basis they can turn someone away who has a Costco optics patient for years. I recognize that she had a patient at the time but I said I could wait until after so she could at least take 5 minutes to tell me if I should go to a hospital or not. Dont ever waste your time going here if you need immediate attention for an emergency because they will not make room for you.
pos	Honestly this is the best pizza that I've had in Arizona.  I'm a sucker for wood-fired goodness and fresh mozzarella--Cibo does both to perfection.  Additionally I've come to appreciate the character and charm possessed by this little gem in a sea of chains and strip malls.    The wine list is not overly extensive just efficient and thorough like it should be.  The salad selection is full of variety and offers a bright way to begin their dining experience.  Be warned:  Cibo is pretty tiny causing a wait on weekends.
neg	Oh boy.. I usually LOVE LOVE Mucho Gusto.. but NO ME GUSTA today!  We got a to go order perhaps that was mistake numero uno.  I got the nachos.. really you can't mess those up... Or so I thouhgt! I mean Filiberto's would have been a better choice!  Can you say cold soggy mess.. maybe that was my fault. I will accept the blame. I really should have known better.   Mistake numero dos... What do you call Shrimp Cocktail with out the shrimp?? Bad Service! Lack of quality control....Really.. Really? You forgot the shimp? How do you do that.... Better question WHO DOES THAT?  Mistake numero tres...lemme just say burned tasting chips (as opposed to my soggy nacho chips) and left an acrid taste in ones mouth and the most offending guacamole that I have ever had.   Let me just say that my co worker and I eat here frequently enough that we can order for each other. We also know to order our guacamole with out the Grand Marnier galze thingy on top.    Mucho Gusto you mucho FAILED me today.  I hate leaving a bad review without first compaining to management so expect a phone call from me shortly.
pos	I love the Madagascar coconut white tea! The prices and very reasonable only downfall for me is they don't list the caffeine content;(
neg	I don't think I have ever been to a restaurant where I have treated so poorly by the wait staff. I'm actually rethinking my Green rating because I sincerely think this is my worst restaurant experience.  The one good thing I can write is that this place is really cute and it has an inviting patio. Lots of string lights and cute bistro tables. I really thought I was in for a great evening. Oh how wrong I was.  My friend and I walked in and the hostess immediately sat us at a four top right in front of the door. Unless the restaurant is packed and the drafty table in front of the door is the last spot available I do not want to sit in a place where incoming guests will constantly bump into my chair. I pointed to a seat in the back and after trying to convince me I didn't want *that* table the hostess led us to the back. It's not the worst thing that could ever happen and that instance did not ruin my evening it was just weird.  We sat and were greeted by our waitress who initially seemed very nice. We both ordered water to start and I asked her for a drink menu. Apparently the drink menu is on the back of the regular menu. It's just so small that I missed it the first time. She told me that Friday night is the $4 frozen house margarita night so I went with her suggestion. By the time I finish pulling out my ID my dining partner was ready to order. We got a queso appetizer the vegetarian tacos with a side salad and the machaca plate.  While we waited a few more groups came in were greeted and received their adult beverages. It had been ten minutes since I ordered my drink so I tried to look for our waitress.   She finally popped up five minutes later but avoided all eye contact with our table. When she did see me she quickly ran outside. I understand she might have had a few tables outside but why have an inside section to wait as well? The table right next to us had an amazing server who brought them two orders of drinks in the time it took to get my water glass refilled. (Margarita was still MIA at this point.)  Then the queso came out brought by two hipsters. It looked like an over-microwaved styrofoam plate in a skillet and tasted just as bad. My friend tried to make the best out of the situation but I was ready to call the manager. I really really regret that I did not.   Nasty queso juice dripped all over the table and there was no silverware or napkins to be found. AND no wait persons or a hostess to ask for said items. (Twenty minutes after I ordered my margarita it was still MIA.)  Our waitress finally popped up and asked how the appetizer was. My friend cut me off and said it was different but okay. He took rare this opportunity to ask for silverware. The waitress made an excuse that it should have been on the table already and went to grab some.  When she came back I asked about my drink.  With another lame excuse that could have been avoided if she ever check on us in the then-thirty minute absence she finally brought me my drink. It was OKAY not worth $4... more like $2-3.   Two seconds later the food came out. At least we had silverware?  1) My veggie tacos and side salad were okay. Is it bad that the BEST part of meal was the white iceberg lettuce salad? 2) My friend's machaca was bone dry. Isn't machaca supposed to be tender rehydrated and edible?   All in all the salsa was the best part of the meal. Yet one cannot enjoy a dining experience on salsa alone. This was sincerely my worst experience at a restaurant and I will not go back to Mucho Gusto.
pos	WOW!  I am very sorry that it took me so long to convince Bri D. to go here.  We went for brunch and it was amazing.  Absolutely one of the best breakfasts I have ever had.  The johnny cakes were out of this world!  They have a granola-y taste to them are filled with blueberries and topped with yogurt and real maple syrup.  It is this awesome combo of sweet and tart that is great.  Despite being three pancakes they weren't heavy and dense like normal ones.  They made me feel satisfied but not \"stuffed\" and gave me lots of energy throughout the day.  That's exactly what the awesome waitress said they would do.  I love this place!  It is beautiful inside I love their theme I love their concept and I love the food.  Can't wait to try more.
neg	Empty tables. Told 15 minute wait. Ok. 5 minutes into wait (by the door bumping elbows with counter patrons) 2 people at the counter complained they had been there 20 minutes. We left at that point
pos	great food... love the pad thai....awesome atmosphere...
neg	Not a company to do business with ... From my experience !'
pos	This store used to be closer to 19th Ave & Bell they have since moved and expanded a ton over the last few years. Everything is made fresh daily ceviche guacamole salsa's they have pan dulce delivered every morning yummm. You can pick up the old school soda's here and good Mexican Favs like Pinguinos Gansitos Duvalin Pelon Pelo Rico De Las Rosa and even Bimbo bread just to name a few thing's they carry here. They have natural all organic small game hens that can be stuffed or bbq'd you can ask for their rub they have all kinds of meat most get the Ranchera here for some carne asada you just need to be able to say how many \"Libras\" (Pounds) and you want them to make it \"Preparada\" they will put in their special marinade w oranges onions and spices in the bag. If your a meat eater you cant go wrong here. I cant get enough of this place!!
neg	I wouldn't send my worst enemy to this place.
pos	Love.  It.  Awesome pulled pork brisket turkey.  The sides are really good too.  I feel like it's somewhat expensive but it's worth every bite but then again that's BBQ.  If it's dirt cheap that means it's not quality meat.  Anyway the 2-pound potato is great too -- chives sour cream butter....
neg	I do enjoy a good bowl of Pho.   This was -not- a good bowl of pho.  grey chicken meat. off tasting broth old bean sprouts 1 piece of a jalepeno pepper... dingy insides.  Weird looks from the server.  I don't think I'll be back.  Not much else I can say
pos	Dilly Dally My Willy Wacky By The Rue  Why do I always forget this place When deciding on where to eat lunch Here I could really stuff my face It doesn't matter if it's dinner or brunch.  My wonderful tasty Honey Do Alfalfa sprouts turkey on whole wheat Add a slice of cheddar for you This sandwhich cannot be beat.   Located not to far from the hospital  So you get a great crowd of nurses The hotties who come here are pivotal I'll stay until the crowd disperses.   Get the soup in a bread bowl Or a bag of chips if you please Add a cookie for your hole I'll say bless you after you sneeze.   Bottom line is you cannot go wrong You'll love whatever you order Go home and hit the bong And then make a run for the border.   DEEEES NUTS!!!
neg	Most horrible buffet I have ever been to.  My boyfriend and I are big chinese buffet fans. A ton of them have raised their prices recently (and not surprisingly have been closing down left and right).. so the prospect of a good buffet at 5-8 dollars was absolutely amazing. We read all the reviews on yelp and I had high hopes.  Dear lord. The food is awful here. Inedible. Tastes very distinctly like a bad frozen dinner.  The only thing I remember being remotely food-like was some kind of beef and onion dish.. which tasted a bit like a philly cheesesteak. not exactly asian fare..  I tried really hard to like this place. My boyfriend didn't like any of it either. I don't understand how they have such good ratings. The ONLY thing I like about this place is their dessert bar because they have toppings for the frozen yogurt. It always annoyed me how so many buffets don't even have sprinkles.. so they've got that going for them.. though I think I'll just go to Mojo or Yogurtland. haha.  In short I don't understand how anyone can eat this garbage.
pos	Anything I write will not do justice to this awesome awesome hotel. I've stayed here a good dozen or so times over the past three years and it's always fantastic. I love all the rooms. If you can get a suite you're an extra lucky duck but even the basic rooms are adorable with phenomenal bathrooms.  The bar and restaurant is also great with fantastic appetizers wonderful specialty cocktails and fun rat pack music. Breakfast is better than most restaurants forget about comparing it to standard hotel fare.  The location is also good with plenty of shopping restaurants and bars within easy walking distance.  This place is not within my normal price range at all but it is worth every penny and I would never stay anywhere else in the Phoenix area.
neg	I suppose you could just put me in the \"box\" with \"Luis T\" on 3.20.10...because if i didnt know any better his could have been my entry.. So i was here this week.  Let me start by saying i have been giving Los Dos Molinos my  business for almost 20 years now and each year that goes by i find myself saying that i am going to cease my patronage.  I will save the stories from the recent years and why i've been feeling this way and give you just the specifics from my most recent visit:  If you want to make the rule that there are \"No Split Checks\" then can you AT THE VERY LEAST get with the current times and make the bill somewhat decipherable?  We had a large party and were quite promptly advised there were no split checks yet at the end of the night we were left with a ribbon of calculator tape with ONLY prices and no correlation with actual menu items...so we had to cross reference the menu to figure out what the heck all the itemizations correlated to.   And by the end of it we pretty much gave up and just guessed at what each person should contribute because the receipt may have just as well been in morse code.  Ok im getting ahead of myself..Its one thing if you have subpar service and the restaurant is slammed understaffed there is a MLB baseball game or NBA basketball game or concert going on...This was not the case.  We were the ONLY table inside the restaurant and the service absolutely sucked.  How many times must one flag down the server for (take your pick) A;  refill on chips B: refill on ice water and C:(most importantly since the drinks are marked up 300\%) a FRESH DRINK!!! Oh yes and D: Check please.  We had to look over our shoulders for A  B C and D.  When our table collectively decided the service was ridiculous we decided the tip would reflect that and then we realized an 18\% gratuity was included...well no wonder.  When that is the case there is NO incentive for decent service!! We brought several items to the attention of the bald headed caucasian man who may have been a manager of some sort but his severe lack of customer service skills merely resulted in him stating in a childish voice \"They are complaining about the service\" to an audience that didnt exist.  Damn right! and damn right we will take our business elsewhere.  Grandma Chavez is rolling in her grave! you should be ashamed!
pos	I brought in six pairs of shoes to Ariel to see if he could put new heels on them (I wear the spiky-heeled high heels).  For $12 not only did Ariel put new heels that perfectly matched each color size and type of heel (and even filed them just a hair so that they would wear smoothly) but he also put a lot of work into fixing the front of them.  Many of my shoes had toes that were worn shredded or faded; Ariel made them like absolutely new.  Amazing!  My shoes are not Prada or Gucci.  They are mostly Nine West with leather uppers and man-made everything else.  :)  However Ariel took amazing care of them as if they were \"the king's\" shoes.  It is so great to have my favorite pairs of shoes back.  I will return.  Thank you Ariel!
neg	Not recommended if you're not white. For me it's the third time somebody threw out racial slurs at my group. I am beginning to think the place is for rednecks and the like. D&B bowling lanes are better.
pos	Best nights to go to Postino's are Mondays and Tuesdays.  They offer $20 deals where you get 4 slices of bruschetta out of the 12 that they offer and one whole bottle of the house wine.  Each bruschetta slice is probably the size of maybe your hand with your fingers outstretched -- if you're a petite girl  :) ...  They then cut each slice into 4's.  Perfect for sharing!  We went on a Monday night after 8PM and ordered 2 bottles of wine the 2 orders of the bruschetta (which were 8 slices for those that can't count) and a bowl of olives.  The total came out to about $50...that's a little over $13/person w/o tip!!  AWESOME!!    PLUS they have complementary valet parking.   Everything was just fantastic I've never had fig before and they made my experience there quite memorable.  I definitely recommend you come in regardless if it's for their $20 deals on Mon/Tues or not.  They've got GREAT food and I WILL be back.
neg	Let's talk about failure baby.  Hey if your idea of salad is punishment via tasteless lettuce and mealy tomatoes splashed with the most generic industrial vinaigrette you've found just the right place to BDSM your tongue. Go for it!  I ordered Capellini Checca and I had it substituted with Spaghetti (I like more girth re: pasta).  What I got was the limpest pile of spaghetti that couldn't be revived with a lifetime supply of Viagra.  The DOA pasta was topped with a pathetic sprinkling of more mealy tomatoes (the menu says Fresh Roma Tomatoes- these had the texture and taste of a dying horse's ass moreso than fresh produce).  The faint acrid garlic tasted like it came out of a shaker bottle and not a bulb- and motherf*&k respectable Checca should have more than 1/16 teaspoon of microscopically chopped basil.    This place makes Old Spaghetti Factory look like fine dining and I would rather starve than be even close to that chain restaurant of culinary doom.  Hell this place is the  disowned cracked-out junkie brother of OSF. It's really *that* terrible.  I gave them the single star only because the management was incredibly lovely and did not charge for the unforgivable disaster masquerading as edible food worth paying for.
pos	I agree with Tracy my wife and I are big fans of Fiorella's. Definitely a treasure for the northwest valley. The service is great and the food is delicious. Prices are a bit higher than other dining options in the area but the friendly people and yummy food are worth it.
neg	The theater itself I have no problem with. Its the fact that we came out of the theater to a broken out driver passenger window my doors unlocked and some Dumb Ass broke into my car and didn't even take anything. Really??  I should've known better given the area but it was the only Harkins showing the movie we wanted to see. Security was nice enough to leave a note on my window.Can you believe there's No Cameras in the parking lot at all!! Ugh!!! Disappointed customer to say the least. Will not be back there that's for sure.
pos	Best UNIQUE breakfast / brunch / lunch spot.  This tiny place may look like a boring little bakery but think again!   SIt outside on the small patio area ck out the GR8 crepes! savory breakfasty sweet - u pick or choose!  Hubby luvs lox & cream cheese & capers.   I luv the chicken aspargus basil feta :-)   Mmmmmmmm.
neg	Tried Shorty's today sadly it will be my one and only visit. To begin service was mediocre at best portions are small(I thought my steakburger was a slider) and there was also the black facial hair that was in between the cheese and burger. That's when customer service went down the drain all we got was a \"that's weird\" and an I'm sorry. If your running a joint and a customer finds a big hair in their food you do whatever you can to save that customer and make them want to come back. Something not just sorry for your luck. I will stick with RocketBurger just up the street cheaper bigger portions tasty and most important they got great service. If I had to sum it up for ya in a few words I'd say\"DON'T DO IT\"!!!!
pos	Places like Made make me realize that there is hope for my life in Phoenix.  It is a cute converted house shop that carries a wide array of stuff that you won't find easily elsewhere.    There is lots of cute baby stuff that I would laugh at if I ever saw a baby wearing.  The jewelery is unique and cool- it made me feel like I had etsy right in front of me live!  They have some good books around and some key David and Goliath pieces.    I heart places like Made so therefore I heart Made.
neg	First of all if you go here PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE make sure you check your bill when it comes!  honestly.  We went here 3 times.  all 3 times we were over charged....  either the menu's were out of date or we were \"past happy hour time\" (BS)... oh and the other excuse... we just changed our menu.  blah blah blah  P  then they always have to \"get a manager\" to come to the table which takes forever!  (I am sure they hope we leave)  PLUS! THE SERVICE SUCKS ASS!!!!  this is a definitely bait and switch!  1st time it happened we just dealt with it and was like whatever...  2nd time it happened my daughter who just got back from deployment (Navy) wanted to do something special for us and took us all there.  My husband looked at the check and noticed it wasy CRAZY over what we thought as we were there for happy hour.  The waitress had to get the manager which took over 20 minutes (gimme a break)  finally we took a 30 dollar gift card because we were so sick of 'arguing about it.  We discussed it about 20 minutes and we were finally like whatever...  3rd time...  took a friend there.  again we ordered devils ale.  on the menu it was listed at one price... when we got the bill it was almost twice as much.  We waited for our server to come back she never did she totally ignored us.  I gave her a dollar tip (which is NOT like me i tip very well too well)  and I wrote on the recept why she got such little money as a tip.    If you are looking for a fun time go caddy corner to San Filepe's  that place is fun and the staff are friendly and fun.  We much prefer there we wll never go to Caddilac Ranch again.  They say 3rd time is a charm Well it is... its a charm to know you are overspending and its a big gimmick and they dont give a crap!  oh and if i didn't have to give a star i wouldn't have.
pos	Lately I have been addicted to a good Caprese style sandwich and Pane Bianco's is AWESOME!  I read the previous reviews so I went there expecting a crowd and nowhere to sit.  This did not detract from the experience for me because the quality and freshness of the food was more than enough to get and keep my attention.  The staff were very friendly and helpful being from the Atlantic Northeast I have high expectations when it comes to Italian done well with personality to boot. I did not want to wait till I got home to eat my so good smelling prize so I went outside to find picnic style tables and benches.  It was way to hot to sit outside and I was craving iced coffee so I went next door to Lux and was both surprised and relieved to find many of their patrons with Pane Bianco bags openly eating their lunches with drinks from Lux to claim patronage.  Can't wait for a hopefully air-conditioned expansion.
neg	Worst customer service of any grocery store I've ever been in.  EVER!  I'd rather go to any other Safeway or any other grocery store.  I'll drive the extra 10 miles just to avoid this place.
pos	A great place for midday healthy food thin crust good pizza ( try wild mushroom & arugula) salads are great too & the best part that serve pretty acceptable nice wines. It is not an average American food eatery it is definitely for those who are looking for healthy low calorie lunch.
neg	Not a fan.  I was in the Biltmore yesterday shopping with my dog and decided to go and buy her a few treats.  As I picked out a bag of about 20 baked treats my total came to be about $3.00.  I did not have any cash on me so I took out my \"plastic money\" the debt card and they wouldn't take it telling me that I needed to buy a few more things because they have a $5.00 minimum.  What store has a minimum nowadays???    The customer service was also very lack luster.  The dogs of the store employees were jumping on me which I found a bit annoying.   Needless to say a store that I used to like I will no longer be back.  There are so many other great dog stores...
pos	The food reminded me of my mom's home cooked meals. The beef with red salsa was super good...and not to mention the warm handmade tortillas. The prices were decent the service was excellent and the food was great. ;-)
neg	Wow.....  Not in a good way  The sashimi was good because all they did was cut it but that was it.everything else made me wish I went real Chinese! Not Chinese making sushi culture theives! P.S. snow crab is not the main ingredient to every roll!
pos	I've never been to this location before. My husband had taken his car here previously and asked me to take it in today (there was a nail a front tire). The second I stepped through the doorway I was greeted even though all agents were busy helping other customers -- excellent customer service to acknowledge I'm there!   Less than a minute later I had a gentleman walk me out to the car and look at it. He tested to see how far in the nail was and realized it didn't puncture so he took it out and said the tire was fine.   I went there knowing my husband is WAY overdue for new tires so asked for a quote. He gave me a few options and told me what driving habits they'd be best for. He also gave me the warranty information without me asking for it and included it in the price instead of \"shockingly\" adding it in when I would pay like most places would. I never thought for a second that I was being oversold. It was amazing because I despise going anywhere having to do with fixing my car.   Quick. Clean. Friendly. Intelligent. Honest. That about sums up this place. I'd recommend it to ANYONE and tell you to go out of your way to visit this location.
neg	I used to love Banana Republic.  I stopped by at lunch to buy a few outfits I wasted quite a bit of time in this store...to an frazzeling degree.  The choppy layout of the new store is annoying.  The clothing line changed drastically so you look like you just came from an overpriced (and cold) beach.  I was looking to dress sharp and professional not wrinkled and hap-hazzard.  I wanted short sleeves not flimsy spagetti straps long sleeved blouses and SWEATERS (hello..its JUNE...and ARIZONA.)  Banana Republic's new format and collection is a huge FAIL.
pos	Tucked on the western edge of the Foothill Acres neighborhood in North Phoenix or what I would call \"The Slope\" Try Me Bicycle Shop has been in business for nearly 40 years and has been collecting the odd part for every type of bike over that time.   The showroom is filled with cruisers and comfort bikes new and used. No high end bikes here but they do have an inventory of old and hard-to-find parts good service and free air that makes this place.
neg	I think chef Silvana Esparza first located the restaurant here on CALLE DIECISEIS (she renamed the street all by herself apparently) to take advantage of cheap rent.  There was no way she was going to locate her Scottsdalish restaurant actually in Scottsdale.  So people from the wealthier areas - and some First Friday urban hipsters whose parents foot their bills - make the trek down to CALLE DIECISEIS to partake in everything Barrio Cafe.  And they think it's cool that they are going there past the check cashing places the people waiting at the bus stops and the \"rawness\" of this part of central Phoenix.  And what is everything \"Barrio Cafe\"????  Pretentious service. LOUD dining room. NO parking. Fusion food that is about 10 years past its prime. High prices.  Let's talk a little about the last item on the list.  Besides using vulgar language in her YouTube videos for pseudo social activism Esparza seems to have forgotten her own humble upbringings.  It's ironic that the very people who live on and around CALLE DIECISEIS cannot afford to eat in her restaurant.  The Mexican immigrants and their sons and daughters who do the cooking the cleaning the landscaping and all that for Phoenix are not welcome at the Barrio Cafe.  I know that this is not a taco truck but there is some overwhelming irony here that you locate your restaurant in a working class area and supposedly have sympathy for the plight of the downtrodden and the neighbors can't even eat  at your restaurant.  I guess that's capitalism.  Like that new car by the way.
pos	Ok so iv been a Starbucks junkie for years....until i discovered dutch bros! This location is my favorite although they are all good. My favorite thing about dutch is you can order ANY blended drink sugar AND fat free. You cant do that with any frappes at starbucks. You cant beat their customer service either all the employees and incredibly nice and upbeat always greeted with a smile! I once ordered a blended double coc coffee and it was too frothy for my liking so i stopped at the location in tempe since i was going that way to order a new one..they exchanged my drink apologized and sent me off with a new drink at no charge. added bonus is the stamp cards so if your an avid coffee drinker like me you'll be saving some money to. Quick drive-through for on the go.
neg	I've now tried Thai Elephant three times.  My first two experiences were solidly mediocre -- nothing was awful but aside from one delicious dessert (black sticky rice with pumpkin custard) nothing stood out either.  As a recent Bay Area transplant I admit to being a bit picky but in my 6 months in Phoenix I've found several places that more than satisfy my rather frequent Thai cravings (Swadee in Chandler Thai Lahna in Arcadia Sala Thai in North Phoenix and in a pinch Thai Hut in Central Phoenix).  Until now Thai Elephant hadn't really done it for me but since the restaurant is literally 40 feet from my office and since other Yelpers seem to have had positive experiences I was reluctant to give up on Thai Elephant without giving it another chance.  On Friday looking forward to a relaxing night at home I called in an order for Pad Thai with chicken Panang Curry with beef (extra spicy) and Spicy Eggplant with tofu (spicy which I thought would be automatic given the name but apparently wasn't).  I got home meted out ridiculously oversized portions of the three entrees and sat down to enjoy my feast.  Wow.  I don't know quite where to begin but to say that I was disappointed doesn't begin to cover it.  The Pad Thai was about on par with the Taste of Thai boxed dinners you can pick up at the grocery store only less flavorful; marginal at best but edible.  The chicken didn't stand out as being of particularly low quality but the noodles were some of the worst I've had at a Thai restaurant (some bites were underdone to the point of being crunchy while others were seriously soggy).  Sadly the sub-par Pad Thai was the high point of the meal by a wide margin.  The Spicy Eggplant was a bland stir fry of soggy overcooked vegetables and limp tofu.  The tofu appeared to have been fried as a large block and then sliced and a few small pieces of eggplant were thrown in for good measure.  The Panang Curry with beef was even worse.  Though I ordered the dish \"spicy\" the curry tasted like straight coconut milk with a few drops of red food coloring thrown in.  The beef was the last straw for me; it very may well have been the worst quality most gristly meat I've had at any restaurant I've ever been to.  I tried several pieces and all were similarly inedible.  I really really want to like Thai Elephant but after the experience I had I don't know if I can bring myself to give it another chance -- especially since I've found so many other good Thai restaurants in the Valley and since the second-worst Thai meal I've had since moving here was at Thai Elephant's sister restaurant Thai Basil in Ahwatukee.
pos	This place always pleases! Their sandwiches are always great bread is great pizza is AWESOME and their short ribs are great. The food is SO fresh! The waiters are kind and friendly. When we asked if they had some of their awesome ice cream she kindly told us the freezer broke. I heart the deli!
neg	RUDE RUDE RUDE I wanted to book a diner for my wife and I ( our anniversary. . The website i was on did not post the times of operation.  I left a message and today got a call back from a RUDE Owner.  He argues it is right there. He did not ask anything about where i was o tried to help . He called to argue  with me.   I can not believe i get a call at work and then when i tell the reason of the issue he argues with me and hangs up... childish behavior . I read the reviews on DEX and other sites and found that this is true across the board. Poor food prep and pretentious environment and owners... good bye Lon's  chief - ill never go to your location now.  And my 12000 Sedona list will  be aware of your bad manners.  I am a native to Scottsdale and Lon's was a place that we went to almost 6 times a year. It was my mother's favorite place to eat. - until the food started going down hill. I believe it was these people who were at the helm at that time. I heard they were asked to leave.  Hanging up on people.... this is incredible...   DO NOT GO HERE!!
pos	Love Love Love!  All you need to do is order dessert here. It comes in small shot glasses & the flavors explode in your mouth..
neg	You want good food? You'd be better off smuggling goat cheese in your boot and risking an anal cavity search for doing so than eating at this airport.  You want scenery? Try desert.   You want a comfortable seat to wait for your delayed flight?  Well you are in the desert so you'd probably better off finding a cactus and straddling it face first.  You want a relatively close connection for your flight? Well tough shit.  Oh yeah they've got people movers but somehow they have this magical ability to disengage people's legs.  Yeah I know it sounds crazy but as soon as people step on to these things their legs stop moving and they plant their fat ass right in the middle of the walk way.  Whats wrong with your legs you mammoth!?
pos	Loved my haircut. Walked in and waited for just a minute. The stylist cut exactly like I wanted and I walked out paying 20 which included the tip.
neg	After a day full of meetings I gathered the hubster and we headed out to eat some Mexican. I had visions of chips/salsa and margaritas. We headed to On the Border on Stapley near Baseline but found that this location had closed. Egads. Then we remembered The Salty Senorita across the street. And thus begins the saga. \"Hi are you here for happy hour?\". We said no but were seated in the bar area anyway. At least we got a booth. Lucky us huh? Joe \"lots of product in his hair\" brought us menus and took our drink orders. He was pushing a certain type of Tequila and I took the bait with the stipulation \"on the rocks with salt\". My drink and hubster's water arrived and we ordered. The chips and salsa AND our dinners arrived at the same time. .Really Joe product??? Chips with the meal? FYI chips and salsa here aren't complimentary you have to order and pay for them. It was then we noticed ants had taken over our table. At first we thought it was just a couple but noooooooo. The hubster brought the ants to the attention of Joe product and he feigned concern but did not offer to sit us at another table. Now the hubster's getting annoyed. It's hard to enjoy yourself when you are swashing ants off the table. Our booth was by a window but we didn't see any influx from the window of ants so we're not sure where they are coming from but they don't stop. Hubster mentions it a second time and then again with feigned concern he offers to move us to a different table. By this time we are almost done eating and I just say let's finish and get the hell out of dodge. Our bill comes we pay and hubster asks for the manager. Hell he's even younger than Joe Product and looks like he just woke up thus we'll call him Bed Head. Bed Head offers to buy us a drink on the house? Really? That's your solution? He said he'd make sure other patrons aren't seated in this area. Egads no thanks we just wanted to leave. We weren't after free food but the offer of 10\% off or some kind of compensation for sharing our entire meal with ants would have been appreciated. A free drink? Heymaybe one of those $60.00 margaritas would have made everything alright! As far as the food goes-I had the chicken antchiladas (get it lol) with beans and rice and they were dry. I like my enchiladas with oodles of sauce and cheese and these had very little sauce with a little design of sour cream on them. Hubster had a steak and avocado salad. He said it was ok.  This is a never return place for us.  And a note to Joe Product-chips and salsa should have arrived WITH the drinks and before the meal.Reflecting back we were there on Earth day so perhaps having ants share our meal was relevant. The margarita gets a 7 out of 10 limes as it was pretty good.
pos	Great for young kids... tons to do and see
neg	We've eaten here a few times and the food was always good.  However the last time we ate there I found a BUG in my food.  When we complained to management they still thought we should pay for 50\% of the meal.  Never eating there again.
pos	Obsessed. Like I've-got-the-Twangy-Tart-withdrawal-shakes level of addiction to this place. Please make one in Arcadia! Pleeeaaassse.
neg	So sad to say I have to change my rating from 5 stars to 1.  I had been a faithful customer of Katie's for years at least 3 or 4!  She told me she wasn't going to be doing nails anymore because she had developed carpal tunnel.  I was heartbroken.  But she told me she was training the others in her shop to be able to do nails like her so I figured I would continue to go there.  Next appt I needed I called and scheduled and said it doesn't matter with who because Katie isn't doing nails anymore right?  I was then told that Katie is still doing nails but she was full that day.  Very hurtful!  I always tipped her VERY well and was always willing to work with her schedule.  But needless to say I don't go there anymore haven't been there since I ended up cancelling that appt and going elsewhere.
pos	Loved the winkie!  Eat your vegan meal next door at Green and stroll over to Nami for dessert.
neg	The cool name of the place is the only good thing here. The burgers are below-average and unenjoyably (is that a word?) messy. Fries too greasy. Seating not comfortable. Skip it!
pos	I have been patronizing Casey Moores for 10 years and have never had a bad night!  Great for people watching and the service is always great!  Get there early or it will be standing room only!
neg	This place has really bad service and the food is barely decent I would advise not to dine here. There are much better Vietnamese restaurants in Phoenix.
pos	I have been saving my 100th review for my favorite restaurant of all time.   We found Thai Basil over a year ago now and have been loyal customers going at least once a week and sometimes more than that since last July. Everyone who works here is super friendly and they know us now and know what we like to order by heart. We just walk in now and they see us and say \"Spicy noodle tofu hot right?\" Its pretty great having a place that knows my regular order. I have tried most of the menu items. The garlic eggplant is also pretty great. The thai basil is also amazing. I have generally liked everything I have had here except the curry. I never have had a good curry experience. Both of the times I ordered it I ended up with long black hairs in it (which they quickly replaced with a new order) but I just wasn't a fan. Maybe it's because of the coconut milk and it makes it too sweet.   The spring rolls are also the best here out of every spring roll I have had anywhere.   Before I went vegan again last year we also got the fried banana ice cream pretty often. That is pretty amazing. If you eat dairy you have to try it at least once.   Thai Basil is one of our regular spots to eat out and we hope its here to stay for many more years to come. I don't know what I would do without my spicy noodles!!!
neg	Lots of \"gay on gay\" homophobia here.  Hick bars in Alabama are more gay friendly.  Staff and owners know this but they do not seem to care.  Oh well
pos	I am in love with the cinema suite! Being able to stretch out your legs on the LazyBoy recliner is the way to enjoy the movie. The chair is spacious and the room is not crowded with viewers.  The foods are at a reasonable price and the server is nice. For movie that are 2+ hours long watching movie on the recliner is the best experience. Also great place to go on a date :)
neg	IHOP is barely a step up from Denny's in terms of boring chain food. Last night was the first time I ever had dinner there and it tasted like squishy mushy cardboard. The food took forever even though there were only three tables in the place with customers.  The reason I gave it two stars instead of you is because the breakfasts are pretty good. I don't mind them except the omlettes which are way too oily. The coffee is almost bad but the waitresses always look happy.  [update April 2 2011]  Why'd I go back? I hate this place now. We went today for the first time we have all had a chance to go out together for breakfast. I was excited to do this and was eager. I should've stayed home.  My wife got a waffle with her combo that was cold tasted like cardboard and was crunchy. The bacon my wife and child ordered was burnt crispy and did not look like bacon at all.  My sausage (I always upgrade to turkey sausage since the regular pork kid here is vomit worth) was totally cold. I sent it back and complained. I think she microwaved my plate.   Their coffee is always burnt so I got an iced coffee. She said they had Mocha Vanilla or Hazelnut. I asked if they just had a regular coffee flavored one... she said yes and brought me disgusting hazelnut (glad I'm not allergic!!)  Ok now it's three hours later. My daughter laid on the floor whining about how bad her stomach hurts I've been to the bathroom twice and my wife is asleep because she said if she didn't lay down she would puke. Seriously.  The management (district managers) really need to care enough to read YELP.  They remodeled the outside of this place and I guess spent all their money to make it look pretty so we'd forget they serve dogfood.
pos	Marcellino's was an amazing romantic dinner experience.  I had their fresh pasta w/mushroom truffles and lobster.  The combination was amazing.  I also had the white wine that's made by a friend in Italy.  It was tantalizing and really lingered on my pallet.  The homemade tiramisu was a blissful ending to dinner.  The staff is attentive and very helpful.
neg	I can summarize this in one word.  YUCK!  We went for dinner/supper which is part of the problem.  We ordered t-bone steak and chicken.  The salad bowl had a hole right through the plastic and the steak was way thin.  We ordered it medium and any steak that thin just ends up being cooked as \"well done\" anyway.  Everything comes with grease dripping hash browns whether you want them or not.  At least the staff was friendly enough and food (if you call it that) was served quickly.  My personal recommendation is that if you're not going to eat breakfast go somewhere else.
pos	Restaurant 28 is a solid hole-in-the-wall that's pretty easy to miss but it's definitely worth a stop.  On my visits I've gotten brisket and other barbecue and my friends swear by the chicken and say it's some of their favorite chicken in the Valley.  The hush puppies are great- the greens are good too.  Another review said it well when they said this place doesn't underseason food.  Every time I've gone it hasn't been bland- it's got some great flavor and it's tasty stuff.  It's in a pretty dull area where there isn't much else to do or I'd be out there more often.  It's a tiny place too but I've never been in and had it be hugely busy or busy to the point that waiting was crazy.  Definitely recommended and I hope they're able to grow and thrive.
neg	I came to the restaurant specifically because of a recommendation. I am now on a gluten-free diet and have other allergies so suffice it to say I don't get to eat Italian often. However I was told that they have gluten-free pasta and other choices. I was initially impressed by the sheet that breaks down their meals by allergen so that one knows what is safe. Kudos on that. This is more than most places provide.  However they have Basil Pesto Sauce listed as NOT being gluten-free nor soy free. Finding that odd I asked the waiter to confirm with the chef and I was told there was no wheat product at all in the pesto which seems correct. (I did not ask about the soy but I would wager that sneaks in somehow thanks to the cheese.)  So I ordered the Create Your Own Pasta of gluten-free penne with pesto sauce shrimp peppers spinach and mushrooms.  When my bowl of pasta arrived it had all of the above. However it also had onions zucchini and eggplant yet I had to dig to find a shrimp. I originally assumed I had somebody else's order.  The waiter who was wonderful and attentive took the bowl away and offered to replace it as I ordered. I would have eaten the original bowl and told him so but I was more concerned as I said that it was someone else's.  As a side note if these flourishes of extra vegetables are an example of a cook's flair I would say that if a customer orders a straight menu item that might be acceptable. But when I fill out a cute little checkbox form with what I want on my Create Your Own Pasta bowl I *only* want the items I checked off.  A fresh bowl arrived later exactly as ordered. Except the pasta was undercooked. I don't mean really firm al-dente. I mean some were still way under done. Now I know that gluten-free pasta takes longer to cook and they probably rushed the bowl to get it to me. But that bowl was almost inedible.  The waiter did offer to get me a third bowl. I declined and soldiered through it. We were having dinner out for my wife's birthday and I did not want to belabor the meal. The waiter then offered us dessert to make up for the problems. Though I did agree to this and I'm not demanding or even asking for a full dinner cost to be covered it seems inadequate for management to offer me a three dollar dessert to make up for a twice-failed $14 dinner.  I do not intend to go back.
pos	The Renaissance Festival is a place where everyone and anyone can venture to in order to awaken their medieval passions and expose a side of them no other place can reveal.  Here people can be themselves without fear of being judged.  They can dress in clothing appropriate to the era eat as citizens of the renaissance age would eat and live a day in the shoes of people whose lifestyle consisted of these aspects every day of their lives all while having a merry time.  What's fascinating about the Renaissance Festival is it is an escape from the everyday bustling industrial environment known to people of the 21st century.  Once you pass through the gates you are immersed in a culture rarely seen these days.  Men women and children of all ages absorb the spirit of the festival and change into someone only such a place can expose.  Immediately you are compelled to have high spirits as people dancing shopping and just continuously enjoying themselves welcome you to the festival.  From there the opportunities are limitless for there are twelve stages of continuous live entertainment jousting tournaments over 200 artisans displaying a variety of unique wares and displays of ancient skills like glassblowing leatherworking weaving woodcarving blacksmithing candlemaking and pottery.  One specific entity of the Renaissance Festival that stands out in my mind is the old coin striking mill tucked away and blended into in the strips of stores surrounding it.  Here a family of three (father mother and daughter) work to produce unique coins crafted into necklaces by means of a punch press.    The store offers some 100 different punch dyes each a symbol possessing its own special meaning.  The categories range from mythological symbols to astrological to even ancient Egyptian.  Once their customer has chosen two of their own special symbols they want imprinted on a coin they place a blank either bronze or silver between each dye and clamp it to a press.  Then a heavy weight is hoisted a few feet above the dyes and then suddenly dropped onto the head of one dye eternally imprinting the symbols on the coin.    What's distinctive about this certain store is they can fulfill the needs of any customer that they are presented with by owning such a broad spectrum of dyes applicable to anyone due to the meaningful descriptions given to each symbol.  Additionally what captivates people is the fact that the coin is formed before your very eyes three feet away making the production a very personal thing for the consumer.    If you and your family are venturing to the Renaissance Festival in Arizona anytime soon which I would undoubtedly recommend be sure to stop in on this special experience not attained anywhere else close by.
neg	Wow this place was steps below horrible. I should have known better considering the place was empty on ASU game night. The food was greasy and flavorless. Everything on the plate was flat... Ya I said it.... Flat. Bland disappointing food. Save your money and eat at taco bell. You will thank me later.
pos	In one word...excellent!  My fiancee and I had an amazing time here last summer when we were upgraded to a Spa Casita Suite because the hotel had found out about our engagement which happened right before we left for our trip.  The room was huge the grounds were beautiful the pool was awesome and everything there was so peaceful.  The concierge helped us with directions to anywhere we wanted to go and the location was great as well...not far from the main drag but somewhat hidden from the outside world.  We are hoping to return soon.
neg	Second to worst dining experience of all time.  Our waitress was a little timid which is fine but it we shouldn't have to wait 20 minutes just to order our food.  Our food took 45+ minutes to arrive and while our friend's steak came out hot our Hibachi Steak and Potatoes were room temperature.  Sent it back to be warmed they offered to pay for it which is great.  Both managers came and said hi and apologized for the slow cook staff and made sure everything was great.   That was the last we saw of them for the next half hour.  We finished our meals and 10 minutes later had to flag down a different waitress to go and find our waiter and to bring us cheesecake menus.  We always get the Dulce de Leche but they brought us terrimisu or some junk.  I gave it back to the waiter (after walking the restaurant to hunt him down) and said \"no thanks I'll just pass on the cheesecake.\"  He looked surprised and later said we didn't have to pay for that cheesecake.  Well I'd sure hope not!  Two hours of my life are gone.  I usually like this restaurant but tonight's service disaster will prevent me from EVER going to this location again free food or not.
pos	Holy AMAZING.  I went here this past Saturday for a baby shower in one of the private dining rooms and was absolutely blown away by the food.  We had a spread which included Mac & Cheese Sliders Chopped Salad some bread and french fries.  I'm still thinking about those sliders and the french fries.  I can't WAIT to go back and order from the full menu.   As is par for the Sam Fox course; the decor is over the top.  I need to find out who designs these places and have them make over my house!
neg	Really if I could I would give this place zero stars because it is a disgrace. If you need an emergency vet in the Scottsdale/Paradise Valley area go to Sonora Veterinary Specialists on Cactus/40th St.(http://www.sonoraveterinaryspecialists.com/). It's also 24/7 but unlike VCA PVEAH it is a truly valuable legitimate facility and it''s staffed by engaged committed deeply caring and extremely knowledgeable and skilled personnel. At SVS you and your pet are treated well and what you pay is fair and justified.  VCA is the opposite of SVS in every single way. VCA is in fact the WORST of corporate animal service providers. The space is small cheap cramped and the staff are indifferent at best and don't convey any genuine love of or concern about animals in pain or distress. All they want is your money. They do NOTHING for the $99.75 they charge for an \"emergency exam.\" We essentially paid that amount just to be given an astronomical estimate literally nothing more--our dog was the exact same bloody traumatized mess we gave to them when they gave him back--after making us wait nearly an hour without ANY communication).  Furthermore they tack on bogus surcharges ($5.25 for a \"biohazard waste fee\") that are irrelevant to the \"service\" provided and their drug prices are absurd--$8 for a single Tramadol tablet anyone?  Conversely our (and our dog's) experience at Sonora Veterinary Specialists was wonderful (even in the context of an emergency) and the cost was ultimately significantly less.  VCA is a money-grubbing depressing sham.
pos	Great experience at the Phoenician specifically Il Terrazzo. We normally buy many loaves of bread from them at OTFM (Old Town Farmer's Market). They were absent yesterday so we called in an order & went directly there to pick it up.  Was gorgeous of course & they were as nice as pie.  And the important part is that the bread was fabulous as always (olive walnut chocolate cherry sourdough farmer's rye wheat sourdough rosemary sourdough baguette).
neg	Not worth comin here. I'm all for food like this but this restaurant sucks. They gave me and my dad the wrong meal and the food was not that good. The meat was dry and the rice was cold. Not worth it.
pos	Great Frozen Yogurt. Helpful staff clean enviroment.
neg	I signed up for Yelp just because of the poor service and being cheated out of money from Cafe Rio. I already voiced my complaint to the restaurant and to their website in writing however I haven't received a phone call or email back.  I've visited this establishment twice and each time I go I receive very little toppings on my burrito or tacos. I understand that it's made to your order like Chiptole or Qdoba but they'll add very little cheese or toppings on your food which can cause you to request more. To save myself time and every yelpers eyes from reading this long story the individual making my tacos was extremely frugal on the toppings on my tacos. She barely put any cheese on my 3 tacos and I simply requested that she could put a little more on the tacos. She did and when I went to pay for my order I was charged an extra 95 cents for \"side cheese.\" The issue isn't the money because eating at Cafe Rio can be expensive for a fast-food mexican restauant but it's the principle of charging me extra after I said \"can you please put a little more cheese on my taco.\"   This hasn't been the first time this happened but a previous visit had the same result with the sauce on my burrito. I thought mexican food restaurants had gigantic burritos and generous size tacos but Cafe Rio will charge you on top of your order if you don't like their skinny tacos.  All I ask for from Cafe Rio to acknowledge that when you add more toppings to what the cook's add to your food that they say \"this will be extra.\" They do this at Chiptole and Qdoba but Cafe Rio would rather screw you over at the end.   I will not be visiting this establishment again. As I said it's the principle as to why they charged me extra for this not the money.
pos	Excellent burgers and sweet potato fries
neg	Surprised this place isn't closed by now. Went here once when I first started going to ASU and never came back.  Their ingredients are not fresh gyro meat tastes old and decrepit. They really need to hire better pita makers who don't resemble drug addicts and derelicts. My pita was falling apart before it was even handed to me. Literally by the time I got it to the table it was soggy and not even worth eating!
pos	Fabulous service tonight and it was crowded!
neg	I will never know what the food tastes like because they were so so rude I will not go back.  We came in and were given a table menus were practically thrown at us.  And then we waited and waited and waited.  We asked a woman working there and she apparently did not speak English and indicated a man at the front would help us.  But he was too busy talking.  We got up and left.  No one even said a word when we left.
pos	I love Scottsdale Child Care & Learning Centers. My daughter started going there when she was 10 months old. The teachers are wonderful. Not only are they nurturing and kind they are also very interested in each child.   My Daughter  has been attending for 6 months now and has graduated to room 2 for toddlers. She knows over 30 words and I attribute much of that to Scottsdale Child Care. She has loved all her teachers and welcomes with open arms each morning when I drop her off.  I would recommend this center to any parent especially if you are nervous about leaving your loved one for the first time.
neg	My mother always told me if I didn't have anything nice to say say nothing!
pos	This place was a huge surprise and a huge relief!  Being a foodie and quite the fan of healthy food this place definitely lives up to those expectations.  If you've ever been to San Francisco then you'll definitely get that feel when you enter the cafe.  It's got a great atmosphere and the menu is by far the best when it comes to serving healthy \"organic\" foods.  I know that many places in the valley claim to serve healthy food but serving \"all-natural\" and locally farmed foods doesn't necessarily mean it's healthy.  People that are true foodie's know exactly what I mean.  I ordered the Dragon Bowl with quinoa and it was delicious.  I'm excited to try this place again.
neg	A couple Saturdays ago went with my mom to get my name added to her accounts should the unthinkable happen. We first went to Chase which took all of ten minutes. The personal banker was great - in-out-done.  Then we headed to her Credit Union at approximately 10:00 AM. They were quite busy apparently. When we checked in I heard grumbling from other customers and asked the wait time.  I was told there were two people ahead of us in line and it \"shouldn't be long.\"  30 minutes later my mom went to ask how much longer it would take. Jennfer who was manning the reception desk dismissed her rudely in front of a lobby of customers. My mom is as sweet as tea in Tennesee so to hear her called out in front of a lobby of people as a disruption was upsetting.  45 minutes later I went up to ask if it would be much longer. Jennifer said curtly \"We're busy.\" Apparently on Saturdays they're busy and one should avoid transacting business there on the weekend. I don't recall being spoken to so rudely at even a fast food restaurant in recent years...  Another ten minutes or so went by (as did my deadline to make another appointment I had made) I was told it would be \"two more minutes\" as I had to go through their background check to be a member. They were having a difficult time with my Washington Driver License and the weird characters it has (an asterisk in part of the number). After all was said and done over an hour later I was approved to be a member and was successfully put as a signer on my mom's account.  I asked for Jennifer's card as I told her I was not happy with the way she had spoken to me or my mother and I intended to speak with her manager.  To that I received a reply she did not have one. The woman sitting next to her informed me she was the assistant manager and that they were busy on Saturdays. My biggest beef was this: If it was going to be an hour to speak with someone tell me. I can make other arrangements or come in during the week. Being told first \"It shouldn't be long\" and then \"We're busy\" is not an excuse. If the business is so overwhelming on Saturdays perhaps it would be wise to staff more people extend the hours or inform people of the wait they're likely to experience because of the queue. Or don't open on Saturdays!  As a 20 year veteran of the service industry I am very disappointed at the level of service Arizona Federal Credit Union provided my mom and me but also all the other people I watched be dismissed like the Credit Union was doing them a favor. After doing some searching for a new home for mom's money she can get a much better rate at a (four letter word forthcoming) BANK!  I'm normally a big fan of member-owned institutions but based on the incredibly rude serviced I received from Arizona Federal Credit Union I'd say go to a Credit Union or Bank where the employees actually read the mission statement that is painted on the wall behind them.
pos	Based on Yelp reviews I went to check this place out while I'm working on assignment in Phoenix. As promised the food was great the service was great and I got to meet the venerable Thomas.  I sat at the bar and the boys took care of me. The Fez Kisra sounded good but I should have listened to Russell's recommendations. I will definitely try those next time which will be soon.  The wine selection was varied but didn't blow my mind. I stuck with whites and found that the one that sounded the best wasn't nearly as good as the most popular (shockingly).  The place combines hip and tasteful decorating good music great food and a nightlife atmosphere. Definitely seems like a great place for a night out with the guys/girls if you don't want to be overly bothered.
neg	Forget the yogurt and the berry berry bad service. The OCD worker with shadow you and serve you a sample with a glaring stare. You'll never feel so ackward adding your toppings since she'll trail behind you and fix the spoons. Yogurt sucks as much as the service so I don't recommend.
pos	Still solid still delicious. I love this place!
neg	This is going to be brutal.  Hide the children.  If you've been to Chipotle you'll feel right at home at Qdoba. That is until you start eating. Complete and utter ripoff of the concept except for the part that matters - the execution.  Where Chipotle succeeds Qdoba fails miserably.  The ingredients are orders of magnitude shittier.  The burritos are just plain bad..  My burrito was loaded with rice and beans and very little meat - basically the opposite of what you'll get at the \"other\" place.  On top of that the rice and beans were the suck.  And if you know Brak you know that he LOVES his beans.  But not these.  About all they're good for is a massive bean fart shortly after ingesting this crap.  If you want to know the root cause of this debacle check out who the parent company is - it's Jack In The Crack®.  Pretty much explains it all.  Avoid at all costs.  Receives Brak's dreaded zero-star review rounded up to 1 because Yelp doesn't allow a zero.
pos	I just wanted to add that in addition to party and catering equipment they also rent heaps of tools and equipment. Think hedge trimmers lawn aerators cement mixers - stuff you might need for a once a year or special project and so don't want to invest in the equipment.  In our case we needed a chainsaw to take down some dead stuff from last winter's freeze an unwelcome sapling a dead tree branches encroaching the roof and to tame some monstrous oleanders.  I was just about to head to the tool rental department at that big box home improvement store when a friend mentioned A to Z. I gave them a call and their prices were competitive. Plus it had that feel good factor of being a local biz.  The process was pretty easy. We got a thorough tutorial on chainsaw operation and safety and were on our way to some serious arboreal carnage.  Pro tip: rent on Friday after 4pm. You can return it Monday morning and only be charged for one day (Saturday) since they are closed on Sunday.
neg	PIECE OF **** manager wouldn't put air conditioning on yesterday. It was 90. They just lost alot of business.
pos	I can always count on Sacks.   It is always fresh and always tasty and the sandwiches are so creative that years later I'm still not sure how they get those fabulous blends and tastes that they do.   I try to hit lunch a little off the lunch hour and then the crowds are not so bad and I can find parking but its worth it to eat a little latter when I know the meal will be so satisfying I can go back to work and be so productive.   Sacks is my \"go to place\" when I have a guest or friend that I want to be well fed and satisfied too.
neg	If we were able to give 0 stars... I would ask to give -1.  I live nearby and am sad to see that a coffeeshop that sells coffee this horrible is still in business in my neighborhood.  Not only was the breve mocha that I ordered disgusting so was the process of watching the barista make my drink.  They use hershey's chocolate from a dirty nacho cheese style pump with chocolate sauce dripping down the sides and coagulated into a thick cap at the tip of the nozzle.  *Disgusting.    The espresso shot was made without care or concern for the fact that it was done way too quickly and with espresso grounds that were ground way before I walked in the door.  Possibly way before the barista started her shift.   *Gross  And finally.  The milk.  She steamed the milk with the automatic steam wand.  This was a huge red flag.  Those are notorious for burning milk and making disgusting drinks.  Well both were accomplished.   The steam wand was tinted white from lack of cleaning.  And the worst part was that near the end of the wand was a DARK CHEESE that had accumulated from burning milk and not cleaning the wand after every use.  Which is FREAKIN - DISGUSTING.  I wasted 5 bucks on an overpriced small mocha and threw it away after taking a sip.    Hundreds of businesses in the area close down every year and there are more realty signs in strip malls in this neighborhood than actual storefronts.  AND I really don't understand why this place hasn't joined the many defunct businesses and starry eyed entrepreneurs in the unemployment line.    If you own a coffeeshop.  Coffee should be your passion.   If you own a bait shop.  Fishing should be your passion. If you just want to open up a business that mirrors a nearby popular chain (short tall grande) please stop wasting space in the strip mall and get a day job in a cubicle.  Never going back warning my friends about this place and am probably going to contact the health department on Monday.
pos	Best Mexican food in phoenix... very reasonable prices...
neg	The food was decent however I am writing about their underhanded business practices. I ordered a travelzoo voucher for $69 that included 2 3 course meals. It said \"Regularly $140\". What we ordered if had been ordered off the regular menu would have been about $100. However we were charged tax on the full $140.   Second even though on the voucher it says \"PLEASE TIP ON THE FULL VALUE OF THE CHECK.\" (which implies tip is not included and we get to choose the tip amount) and nowhere mentions automatic gratuity 18\% gratuity (18\% of $140 even though we ordered $100 worth of food at the most) was automatically added to our check.  Third even if you had ordered the most expensive options the highest possible amount it could be worth is $120 not $140. It is mathematically impossible to have the voucher be a $140 value but that is what they add tax and tip to.  Fourth after we told our waiter we were using a voucher he seemed less interested in the service level of our table which i later realized was because he had a guaranteed 18\% (of $140) tip.  I just noticed today they have another travelzoo deal \"$79 - AWARD-WINNING FRENCH DINNER FOR 2 W/WINE REG. $165\" I am posting this so hopefully if anyone is thinking of buying that voucher they will read this first before they purchase it.
pos	Just want to Say ThankYou Hawaiian Airlines for Making My Grandparents Flight Very Enjoyable. They Say Nothing But good things
neg	This review is based on delivery service and food quality as delivered.  Second and last time I will be ordering from this place. The first time they forgot a few items and were very off for delivery time.   Tonight I Ordered at 11:03 PM estimated delivery at 11:50 updated to 11:54 PM (from a whopping 1.5 miles away to add). 11:54 comes and goes. Call them at 12:07 AM now I am told they are on their way (1.5 miles away keep in mind). Call back at 12:40 AM to cancel my order as I do not want to eat at 1:00 AM. They actually come to deliver while I am on hold waiting at 12:44 AM. My \"hot sub\" is ice cold there's nothing like the taste of cold greasy bacon and chicken close to 1:00 AM on a Monday (now Tuesday) night...if you are going to take nearly 2 hours to deliver this at least make sure the temperature is somewhat close to where it is supposed to be....never again silver mine...never again.  This place probably has a \"good taste potential\". Unfortunately like most \"hot food\" the taste quality substantially decreases the longer it sits...in a fridge alley or wherever they decided to leave it for nearly 2 hours. If you feel the need to get food from here..for the love of sub kings please just DON'T GET DELIVERY!
pos	Brought my parents here for lunch last time they were in town.  Dad loved his gyro. Mom and I both got large salads hers chicken and mine gyro meat.  SO much delicious food for not a lot of money.  Between my Mom and I's leftovers I had a full dinner to eat later.    Hooray for pleasing the parents!!
neg	the owner was dishonest she posted a menu outside with lower pricing to attarct traffic and then charge higher pricing menu inside. she also charge me 12\% sales tax which is illegal in tempe which suppose to be only 9.3\% very rude manner not recommended
pos	Okay so I have a little bit of bias towards Nordstrom.  I freaking love Nordstrom!    The store is always clean and the staff are always friendly.  I have never had such good service anywhere else.  I especially love that Nordstrom will return or exchange an item with no questions asked.  Aside from the service the selection is very nice.  I always go during the half yearly sale so that I can get some good deals on my designer duds!  I am big on shoes and the selection is very good.  They always have some cool shoes that I can't seem to live without.  Also the staff in the shoe department are very good on helping to make suggestions when I am not sure what I want.  If you go go in June or  January when the sales are great!  Make sure you check out the shoes!
neg	Only reason for 1 star is 'cause I got arrested here for underaged drinking years ago.  I blame the Diamondbacks for no legitimate reason.
pos	While I love that it is Native American owned and operated the best thing about this restaurant is the food - as it should be.  I don't go out to eat to be entertained or charmed - just fed better than I could be at home and that is exactly what this place does.    The food is amazing. The fry bread isn't greasy and I don't know how they do that.  The meals are flavorful filling and reasonably priced.  The only thing I would do is add some tomatoes to the tacos but that is a minor quibble.    If you want to go out for a delicious meal in a casual place and not pay a lot for it GO NOW to the Fry Bread House.
neg	Their amazing prices are instantly countered by despairing customer service.  If I want low prices I will go to goodwill over this place.  Looks like Dillard's is on my list of do not shop.
pos	My wife and I have made two trips to Roberto's from Dana Point CA (400 miles) and we haven't been disappointed.  Although its not the only reason for our visit a stop at Roberto's is a must when we're in the Phoenix area.  I have tried and thoroughly enjoyed the al pastor tacos beef chimichanga burrito and I really like the way they crisp up the carnitas.  My wife judges a Mexican restaurant by the quality of its chile relleno and says this is the chile relleno she has been waiting for: two to a plate great presentation and delicious.  The light breading allows the flavors of the chili and cheese to dominate the palate as they should.  She also recommends the tortas she had at breakfast. The bread light and toasted perfectly hugs a generous helping of carne asada (with fajita style onions and peppers) and if you like guacamole.  Pair that with a cup of their terrific coffee or if you have never had Jamaica a delicious Mexican beverage brewed fresh from flowers try it.  Either way you have a breakfast you won't forget.  Oh and by the way the members of the local fire department showed up to order breakfast while we were there.  If they are eating there you know it's good.  Just had to thank them for their service.    This is truly a restaurant where family meets family Roberto's and yours.  And for you insiders we both love Roberto's homemade tamales.  Although they're not on the menu we have been fortunate enough to take some of their tamales home during both of our visits.  I believe tamales are normally made for the sale in the store on Thursdays (check with them to be sure) but they don't last.   On our first trip in 2008 to their old location we stopped in for lunch (excellent) and were told that they were bringing in homemade tamales that afternoon.  We returned that night for dinner and to pick up some tamales that they kept for us.  During our most recent trip we stopped in for breakfast on a Saturday.  But fortunately for us they were making tamales for a catering job the same day and sold us some of their extras.  We again returned in the evening for dinner and to pick up some tamales.  These tamales are just like I wish my (Chinese) grandmother used to make.  Check with them to see when they're available.  They're really worth the extra effort.  Although Roberto's delivers I regret that they won't come to Dana Point.
neg	This was by far the worst restaurant experience I've ever had.  I paid $20.00 for a show and dinner. I received the show only because it was from an outside source. The show was 2 hours long and by the time it was over half the restaurant I'd say 50 to 80 people still had not been served. They didn't have enough menu's for people to even order off of. Some guy in shorts walked around with buckets of silverware wiping them on his shorts then placing them on the table. The show started at 7:00 at 9:30 I still had no food. The people who did get food complained that it was terrible. Maybe I should be happy I didn't get any food. When I asked again about our order the waitress said she would take care of it. The guys in the kitchen were overheard saying \"f---k those people no more orders! not only did we not get the dinner we already paid for they flat out refused to give us dinner or our money back. We ended up at Dennys eating eggs at 11:00 . Seriously I've never had such a bad experience in my life. Can you imagine paying for a dinner then being refused the dinner or a refund? unbelievable
pos	When I mean 5 star I mean 5 STARR...but this place is SPECTACULAR!! Pavle & Charleen are such a fantastic duo....they really know how to make your dining experience exquisite!  The food not to mention the service is truly unbelievably delicious!! If you want to have some amazing food and get top notch service while doing so the time has come for you right here in beautiful Arizona!! HATS OFF FOR FnB!!
neg	This is the worst Pizza Hut I have ever been to. I was up-charged for something I didn't order. When I asked for it to be corrected it was done wrong again given the wrong change and had the drive thru door slammed in my face. Asked to speak to the manager and he was extremely hostile. He took my change receipt and food. After some time I asked for a refund and was told that wasn't possible too much paperwork. Asked for his supervisors number and was told he was the highest manager there was no one above him. Right.   I went to the next Pizza Hut and asked for the regional manager number. I left the food at the restaurant because I was no comfortable eating it after he took it back to correct their mistake. Not sure what could have been done to it.  The young girl at the window did get it wrong twice but the example the store manager gives is piss poor and is the issue. I hope Pizza Hut sees who they have working for them and speaking on their behalf because according to this store manager Tim he's the owner and CEO of the company. I highly doubt that.
pos	WOW!  Great donuts!  Honestly you can't eat just one!  I loved the plain glazed and the old-fashioned!  Not like the franchise donut shops these have the real bakery taste!
neg	I'm convinced that anyone giving this airline more than one star is most likely associated with them and is concerned about their job.  I've been flying with them for 7 years back to NC to see my aging mother.  I fly 3X/year on the same flights.  The service and attitude of the employees has been getting progressively worse.  I am also a pilot (20) years and I understand the weather and air traffic control VERY well!  This rant is not about operations security or delays.  It is about the customer service by pissed off employees.  My wife said that if she was not with me on my last trip she would not have believed what happened.  I forgot to purchase my own bottle of water before getting on the plane in Charlotte.  The beverage service was 2 hours into the flight!  This old cranky b#$\%^ came by and said \"what do you want?\"  I said I would like to have a soda and a water.  She said you can only have one or the other.  I was so thirsty I asked for the water.  It was a very small glass that I drank very fast and then ask for a refill...please!  She said \"I told you that you could only have one\"  and pushed the cart away.  Even the people around me were in shock.  The check in personal were equally as rude.  If you are watching the internet news there was an article a few weeks back that rated customer satisfaction and US Airways was at the bottom!  I for one will never fly with them again.
pos	Saw this place while I was picking up pizza for my kids.  I didn't want pizza thought I would go in and give the tamales a try.  I haven't regretted that decision at all.  The chicken tamales are the BEST!  They are super spicy the way I like.  The beef with red sauce is great too not very spicy at all.  The masa in all the tamales is flavored wonderfully.  I am hooked on these tamales.
neg	Our family made the mistake of dining here on Thanksgiving. Everything from the table to the food to the clueless and absent waiter was outright below average and certainly no where near the kind of restaurant described in the other reviews (which I wonder now if were written by the owner or manager). What a disappointing holiday.
pos	I was in Phoenix a few weeks ago on a business trip. Lucky me Thai Elephant was right across the street from my hotel! This is a tiny little joint maybe 20 tables. The menu is like a book there is so much to choose from rice dishes noodle dishes soups appetizers. My coworker and I settled on a red curry dish with chicken and I had a sweet & sour dish (yeah it sounds trite but I was in the mood and it was so delicious!) We had tons of leftovers which we shared with a homey down the street I hope he enjoyed it. Highly recommended and if I'm ever back in town I will visit again.
neg	Don't bother with this place.  I had never been here my husband and I decided to pick up some food to take home.  We ordered a shrimp tempura appetizer an assorted tempura appetizer a lobster appetizer and yakisoba.  When we got home the order was totally wrong. Instead of lobster we were given mussels (which were gross) instead of assorted tempura and shrimp tempura we only got assorted tempura with 2... that's right only 2 shrimp in the whole mix.  The yakisoba was the only part of the order they got right and it was not that great pretty bland.  I love Japanese food and I was really excited to find a place near by and while we were waiting for our order we were excitedly planning to come back and have their sushi but after this complete mix up and poor quality food there is no way I would trust them with anything raw.  Never going back such a complete disappointment.
pos	It was 3:45pm and I'm about to jump on a bus to the light rail.  We have no reservations for Pizzeria Bianco but a couple of friends just got in line and were waiting to get some wine.  Useless fact: they're 26th in line.  So in theory at 5:00 we're in the first seating.  And so it happens the publicly-underwritten public transit arrives (my one-way trip cost $1.25 my gf's unvalidated parking fee was $12) and two Hop Knots later we're sitting down and waiting.    Typical order one of everything two Biancoverdes.  At this point being almost review #200 the details are irrelevant.  The crust is great the cheese is great the Sonny Boy is uber-salty and delicious fruity olive oil holy shit these roasted peppers etc.  Why is that person staring at me through the window?  So I guess the point is if you make it your only point to go to Bianco it's hard to be disappointed.
neg	Ive eaten here twice and I dont think Ill ever eat here again. I ordered the lettuce wraps and the food smelled like horrible BO. It made me so nauseous I couldnt even eat it. The salad is decent but I still cant get over that smell!
pos	Dr. Greg Allen is the best doctor in the East Valley and probably the state! He has the best of bed side manners and is caring in his listening to the patient's needs. We have used him for several years and trust him completely.
neg	yuk! service and food sucked never a gain!
pos	INCREDIBLE food relaxed/great atmosphere perfect to bring kids/family...the cheeseburger shredded bbq pork sandwich sweet potatoes- too die for! Must try! Worth the drive!
neg	I went today with three friends for dinner around 6 PM Sunday night. Though it seemed quite busy I was pleased to get a seat within two minutes upon arrival. Outside seating despite a hot Arizona summer was pretty nice with shade. However this is where the pleasanties end.  Our table remain neglected for approximately twenty minutes. No one bothered to offer us drinks and it was quite irritating to see tables who arrived after us being served appetizers. When our waiter came he did not even apologize for the wait and we gave our orders: drinks appetizers and pita sandwiches.  The hummus and garlic dip came relatively quickly only twenty minutes later. Both were alright but something is seriously wrong if all of us were only served one pita with the two dips and each dip was more than twice the size of the pita. We asked our waiter for extra pita and he kindly agreed. The entire duration of dinner it never came.  Refills were also a pain as we would ask someone to fetch our waiter and he wouldn't come until ten minutes later.  An hour after ordering could not possibly justify only four meager gyro sandwiches. I've been to plenty of other businesses who have made that kind of order and more in just ten minutes during a busy lunch hour. Half the tables outside already left including tables that arrived after us and we were the last ones served. The food was of average quality and I've been to better with cheaper prices.  Slightly expensive I can see as justified. But many agree that time is worth much more than money. I had an excessive amount over an hour and a half wasted on a decellerating Sunday night. Staff is kind of nice but I suggest a serious change in priorities so that first time customers like myself aren't immediately turned off. I can say for certain that I'm never coming here again and I'll find myself at better places much closer to home.
pos	GET. THE. CIDER. Just do it. I'm a huge cider fan and this is the best I've ever had. Not syrupy sweet and nice and cloudy so you know that it's been brewed from actual fruit and not some secret sugar concoction. Their master brewer also brews all of their sodas. Grab a taster for the sodas and see which one you like best. My favorite is the vanilla. The staff is ridiculously friendly and willing to answer any questions you have and will have a nice chat with you if they're not busy.   The sandwiches are quite tasty as well. I've had the Mario's Monster Mill-wich and my boyfriend has had the tuna and the French dip. All have been really good but if you don't like a lot of feta on your sandwich I would suggest letting them know because they really pile it on (Mario's)! I love it so it was no problem for me.
neg	I hate to give this place 1 star but my recent experiences were horrible. I use to dine at this restaurant often with my family. The more we go service decreased. Our water cups never get filled.  The very last time I was there I found a gnat in my pho. Although I have eaten about 50\% of the medicore pho they asked if I wanted another bowl. I said no; I was there on my lunch break. No time to wait for another bowl. I got up to pay for my bill and to my surprise there was no discount or any sort of accommodation.   I am disappointed with them and will not be back.
pos	I got the best KEEN hiking boots on sale here and they have a great selection of dog frisbee and dog boots and dog toys. I like this location nobody bothers me and I can mill around without anyone bothering me.
neg	The worst Thai food I've ever had! This place was recommended to us by another couple and wow was I disappointed!  Everything was completely blase and tasteless the only exception being the extreme spiciness of my fiance's entree(probably to make up for the lack of other spices)...  don't bother with this place.
pos	Everything here is awesome! I love the Kung Pao shrimp and the Hong Kong soup which has wontons and and egg noodles they make in house. The soup they bring out before your meal is delicious as well. Everything tastes made to order always fresh never greasy and is presented beautifully. The staff is very friendly and attentive. Definitely try this place! It's a regular lunch spot for my office. They also have great lunch specials. :)
neg	Went there for a quick bite before the theater.   Had the buffalo sloppy joes and they were disgusting--dry buns thin sliced pickle.  Then had the duck spring rolls--also bad.   Then in an effort to eat something we could tolerate ordered the lettuce cups with shrimp and they were just adquate.   Very disappointing!
pos	They have anything from salads pitas wraps burgers and wood fired pizzas.  Although this isn't a 100\% plant-based restaurant they pride themselves on having many vegan options.  Not only are there options but upon visiting their site I found a table of what items are vegan what aren't and what makes them non-vegan (which is always nice to know). Great to have so many vegan options that are spelled out on their website.    We expected a counter-service experience but were pleasantly surprised when we entered to find it was an actual sit-down restaurant.  The vibe was a classy yet laid back youthful feel.  Most of the servers were high school or college age and wore regular street clothes (think Urban Outfitters style).  I loved the laid back atmosphere of the servers even though it's a sit-down experience and really enjoyed the color scheme and tin plated ceiling.  The food was absolutely FANTASTIC.  Oh my. For an appetizer we selected the garlic dip with two pitas.  The garlic dip is a mix of olive oil lemon juice fresh garlic and smashed potatoes.  If you love garlic you'll love this.  My husband chose the Falafel Pita which was topped with cilantro and spices mixed greens tomatoes onions pickles and tahini.  He was very happy with his choice although next time he'd ask for no onions.  I went with the Veggie Garden Wrap that included zucchini broccoli cauliflower eggplant yellow squash carrots onions tomatoes brown rice mixed beans ginger herbs and garlic.  One thing we quickly found was that our entrees were HUGE.  This is not a complaint in anyway.  However next go around we may share an entree.  Either way this visit we had leftovers to take home for lunch the next day.   Will definitely return.
neg	After sitting at our table for 30 minutes and not getting any service we left.  But not before the hostess said thanks for coming in. Needles to say I will not be returning.
pos	NO BETTER BREAKFAST IN AZ. From scrambled eggs to their blueberry pancakes. Top end. Yes you pay for it. But it's special like Valentines Day. Just pay out and enjoy the treat. Lunch is also nice especially if you get a seat outside so you can people watch. Great wraps and sandwiches. Haven't tried anything later here yet. But I saw their happy hour specials and it is on my TO DO list.
neg	I will never make another purchase from this company ever again! The company tried to deliver damaged furniture to my home and then gave me the run around about processing a refund when I refused to accept the items. After 5 phone conversations they agreed to refund me for refusing damaged items. I cannot recommend this to anyone.
pos	Great tasting frozen yogurt excellent customer service very clean inside. Healthy choice for a sweet treat.
neg	Was I there on a bad day or what?  I showed up 15 minutes after they opened and EVERY item I tried was either luke warm or cold.    They have 15+ items on the lunch buffet and I tried a bite of all of them.   Gross and bland.   I felt sick to my stomach after I left because I kept thinking how bad the food was. Yuck!
pos	If you are looking for top-notch produce and organic goodies then NGD is the best. Pricing can't be beat and it's delivered as well. Always great quality and a large selection. Easy ordering process and awesome customer service. One of the reasons I am sad not to live in Scottsdale anymore.
neg	veerrrrrryyyyyyyyy dirty. I think I will buy them some clorox wipes and light bulbs for their sign out front. I made 12 u-turns trying to find this place.
pos	I can't say enough good things about this place.   Quick disclosure: When I was working for the Downtown YMCA I discovered Local Breeze as I was searching for businesses to participate in our fund-raising campaign. Local Breeze was totally down to contribute. So on top of getting that delicious meal know that your money is largely going back to the community. Awesome.  But the food (and drinks) are really what keep me coming back. The coca-cola ham is delish and the serving sizes are pretty decent. You definitely get your money's worth. And there's a reason why my profile says that my \"recent discovery\" is \"spiced cottage cheese from Local Breeze.\" That was written months ago but I don't think I've discovered anything quite as amazing yet. And I normally don't even like cottage cheese.  The last time I went was for my bday dinner and again it didn't let me down. We had good food good drinks and a good time in general. The bartender mixed up this killer cucumber martini which sounds weird but if you're a martini fan go for it. If you're feeling less risky you can't go wrong with their mojito.
neg	Jimmy Johns is cheaper and better ... The Capriotti food is heavy ... and it doesn't taste as good as you think it should taste
pos	This place is literally within walking distance from my apartment yet I have passed by it daily. This morning I was hungry for breakfast and had a lot of things to do so I thought I would try something close. I have noticed the parking lot is usually full so I thought it must be good. I had no idea what type of food they had or what to expect.  It was Sunday morning just around 9:30 and I was fortunate to be able to walk in and instantly have a table. The server was very friendly and she checked back often always refilling my coffee. The menu is a little newspaper and it's a bit overwhelming with many options but I finally settled on the volcano. It is described as three pancakes 2 sausage links 2 bacon strips and an egg. The pancakes are three different sizes and stacked to create a volcano with the egg on top. It was under $9 and I was surprised at the size of it! I attempted but could not finish it. The big pancake was left uneaten. They do have a smaller option for around $6 and that might be the better way to go unless you have just returned from a month long trip through the jungle or plan to share with someone.   The server continued to check on me and even offered up a to go cup of coffee. I don't know how I have overlooked this place but based on the experience today I would put it right at the top of best spots in town for breakfast. I will say come early because by the time I was leaving the lobby was full people were milling around the parking lot and the wait to be seated was 15 minutes.
neg	I just thought I'd post an update.  I planned never to go back but was with a friend who really wanted one of their breakfast items.  I skipped ordering ANY food whatsoever and merely ordered coffee and watched her eat.  As fate would have it she had a BACK HAIR in her scrambled eggs (we are 2 for 2 now).  My gag reflex is going off as I type this.  My husband friends and I have renamed this place the Black Hair Diner and we've decided they have actual black bears cooking in the kitchen since they can't seem to keep black hairs out of their food.
pos	So perfect. The atmosphere is just spot on. I love going whether it's just to grab coffee and leave or if I am there studying or just want to chill. I love their Apple Harvest (?) salad. So delicious and beautifully prepared. Baristas are always very nice (especially Brianna!). Can't wait to hopefully become a regular and attend some of the live music events they put on every week!!
neg	I am a huge fan of Chipotle but I will never come back to this location. The staff looks miserable and are SLOW. The cashier decided she would rather clean tables then ring people up so we waited for her to come back. Most of the tables were already clean so she could of waited to clean. The rice was crunchy like it wasn't cooked all the way and the steak was really chewy. Never again!
pos	Excellent customer service super clean and the food's not bad at all.  Despite the fact that I asked for extra mayo on my sammy but got NO mayo was a little annoying.  But for some reason something told me to pick up some packets of mayo.  So I was in the clear and my annoyance never gained traction into anything that prevented me from returning.  That and the sandwich was pretty yummo.  They also give a pickle and a free bag of chips to go with it.  I do not however recommend the chocolate chip cookie.  No bueno.
neg	Worst slow service ever....especially with almost no one in the place. Food was average at best and thats being kind. Skip it if you are looking to eat or get a drink.  Just an update: I (as well as a friend who wrote a review of the day) were contacted (I didn't see my message until today oops) and offered refunds and gift certificates. Now this seems all well and fine-I do appreciate them trying to make the most of the situation-but my friend is still waiting for a refund and/or certificate. So we shall see. If I could take away my star for more non-service then I would.
pos	I traveled to Phoenix often for work from the early 90's to the late 00's and the first thing I'd do leaving the airport was to hit the Pink Pepper lunch buffet hence I've never ordered from the menu or had their dinner service but their lunch buffet was awesome!  Very reasonably priced including an iced tea.  It may not necessarily be the most authentic Thai food as I think they reduce the heat a bit but the flavors were excellent and the variety was good.  Loved their eggplant dish (can't recall the name) and their crispy chicken with the creamy sauce and of course the usual curry sauce dishes.  If I'm ever back in Phoenix again the Pink Pepper will be one of the first places I go.
neg	I had not eaten in about 12 hours since we were at the hospital having a baby... and this pizza STILL tasted horrible.  Barely average fast food quality and taste. Avoid!
pos	OK being from Wisconsin (the land of the \"great lakes\") I was COMPLETELY surprised to be told that yes there are lakes here in the desert of Arizona.  The Lake Saguaro Lake is a man made lake originally built as Stewart Mountain Dam...even so its beauty is equal to those you would see in the glacier regions of the Midwest.  I was amazed frankly at how beautiful this tour was.  Sold for $18 for 90 minutes you get your money's worth.  But that is probably not what you want to hear...  The \"event\" is a combination of 1) the scenery and also 2) the charm of the paddle boat itself.  The boat is quite large with seating for probably close to 75 people!  It's an event that you could share with family but I happened to be there with friends.  Currently it's a pretty mellow type of event (great for Mother's Day!) although I am told that they are hoping to exploit its benefits to include comedy shows Jazz ensembles stargazing and a variety of other events.  P.S.  They also advertise that you can rent the paddle boat for company picnics weddings and the like.
neg	I took my kitty to the Beat the Heat low cost spay event and she came home with a hematoma in her ear that was NOT there when I took her there in the morning. Surprise surprise...they can recommend a vet to take her to. I'm pretty mad about this.
pos	Had the pastrami sandwich. It brought me back memories of living in NYC and eating that first pastrami. It was good.  Good food hAs the power of time travel.   This is a great place. Plus the coke is primo. Good mixture. The ice makes it over the top.
neg	I had such a nice experience here - Classic Chicken - the first time that I really wanted to go back. Second time onion strings were so greasy I couldn't eat them burger was okay. Third time yesterday? Enough to say we wont go back. Ever.   Lovely and I sat in a sticky booth he ordered 1/3 lb classic me the bbq grilled chicken - both with a small soda. Soda was disgusting flat watery gross. Upon the lovely's complaint the bus boy brought him bottled water. I took one bite of my sandwich and was assaulted by hair. Gak. We got up and left our food. Jeff told the manager about the food and the soda we got our money back with an apology saying they were sorry we 'didn't have a better experience'. Um. A better experience??? Seriously? 15 dollars?   Ugh.
pos	Eden's Grill has to be one of my favorite and newly discovered Middle Eastern/Mediterranean restaurant in the PHX metro. Located in a sleepy strip mall close to Artie's Ace is EG. My partner and I had the opportunity to have dinner here a few weeks ago and we were totally wowed by everything! We started off with the hummus followed by two orders of the vegetarian plate. The vegetarian plates were huge and featured dolmades falafel rice veggie skewers and veggie patties (2). The vegetarian plate was massive and everything on the plate was delicious. Next time we'll pay the extra $5 and split one Vegetarian Plate instead of getting two. The pita and hummus were fresh and delicious however I find EG's hummus to be a a little thick for my preference and they use a heavy dose of tahini in their hummus. Overall I would totally recommend EG to anyone with an itch for Middle Eastern/Mediterranean food but be warned they aren't open for lunch on the weekends yet.
neg	I usually do not write reviews but was so horrified by my experience I had to. Went for a late night bite and drink with a friend they were fairly busy so we had a seat at the bar. As I frequent The Moon often I was happy to see the bar was busy as well. The bartender quickly came over and was noticably intoxicated as she could not even tell me the flavors of vodka they had. We ordered our drinks and watched as she broke glass into the ice knocked over glassware and broke a beer bottle. As we looked around most of the guests had the same look of horror on their face. We decided to order some food as she spilled my drink on us (refilled it with something completely different) and she could barely even talk at this point. We saw management watch her behavior and do nothing as she preceded to grab dirty glassware and refill it with beer. I was so appauled by this we left befpre finishing our drinks or food. I'm not sure what she was on but if its visible to paying customers it should be visible to management. Being beyond embarassed for the establishment I would doubt I will come back sad as we would frequent the Moon 2-3 times a week. Horrible.
pos	Consistent is a great word to describe this place. The food is consistently great; the service is consistently great; the regulars are consistently there. (they're great too). It has a comfortable smoking/drinking patio and great prices during happy hour. The staff and owner is always (consistently) accommodating and friendly. You feel like you are part of the family here.   Food I'd recommend: Any fish served Greek style the Prime Rib the burgers and definitely the fillet medallions with the gorgonzola wine sauce. All the food is good though and you gotta love the salad bar!
neg	Most livable city my eye! Plastic yuppies around every corner looking for a reason to belong.  I can't wait for the homosexuals to take control of this dog park and give it some class.  Avoid at all cost.
pos	How have I gone this long without reviewing the lodge? Sheesh! I get all fluttery inside when I think about the lodge. The Mac and Cheese is not something to play around with. It is a dish of fantastic cheesy wonderfulness. Also please note the veggie wrap. HOLY SMOKES. Its a heavenly combo of sauteed veggies feta cheese and some kind of lemon/herb/heaven sauce all wrapped up in a pita! Really? Really Aaron May?  The other aspects of the lodge I enjoy involve the friendly staff and comfortable setting. It's decorated all rustic and cushy and true to form there are antler-chandeliers. You will also find pool tables darts several TV's jenga bean bag games...they have plenty going on at the lodge to keep you and your friends entertained. Check it out...
neg	This place is awful.  I bring my fourteen year old daughter along for services once in awhile and on two occasions here they managed to seat me and skip her for other clients that did not have appointments.  They wont accept a tip from your debit/credit card which is pretty inconvenient if you don't carry cash.  They use a cheap base coat in an unmarked bottle that leaves my polish job looking funky. My mother was a loyal client until she got an infection in her toe after a visit.  I don't like to write bad reviews but this place does not deserve your business.
pos	Just went for my first time last night with \"the \"girls\". Two of us heard about it and after I read the reviews and checked out the menu it was slated for our next night out. Anyway we had a memorable evening with wine the make-your-own cheeseboard and the to-die-for pear and gorganzola flatbread pizza. It was topped with fried sage leaves -- different and delicious. Afterward we were able to fit dessert and shared a huge slice of fresh layer cake filled and frosted with dark chocolate. Sublime! Can't wait to go back and try other dishes - definitely made it to my 'Restaurants to Frequent' list :)
neg	I'm a little shocked how high this place is rated to be honest.  I'm not disappointed easily but I've given this place three chances to impress and they've consistently disappointed.   I live nearby and was very excited for a new trendy place to eat & drink. The first time we went there we sat at the \"outside\" bar. The male bartender was not personable at all-he was actually quite rude. When I politely asked him if he knew the price of a liquor off the top of his head (and not to worry about it if he didn't I was just curious) he snottily replied with \"well there's not a button for it so I don't know.\" He then rolled his eyes and walked away. I was astounded at how rude he was but shrugged it off. I actually felt bad because I thought somehow I offended or embarrassed him because he didn't know the price of this particular liquor so I apologized to him and he proceeded to made another smart comment about how he charged me the well price but that the next time I come in it might be much higher again being very snotty and rude. My boyfriend was actually pretty upset at the way he spoke to me but chose to let it go because we just aren't the type if people to be confrontational or to complain.  After our meal and about an hour before close he told us he was leaving and that another girl would be taking care of us. When she showed up all she did was clean the bar in preparation to close (even though that wasn't for another hour) and didn't even introduce herself or say hello. I waited for her to notice that my boyfriend's Blue Moon was empty but she was too busy cleaning so I asked her myself. She asked me what beer he was drinking I told her then watched her pour the wrong beer and give it to me as if I wouldn't notice. (Not all alcohol is available at that side of the bar. For instance Blue Moon and the liquor I was drinking are stored at the main bar another point of annoyance for the original rude male bartender. But how is that my fault? I didn't know that.  And clearly this girl didn't feel like going to the other bar to pour the correct beer for my boyfriend even though she specifically asked me which beer he was drinking and then lazily poured whatever wheat beer they had in tap at the bar we were sitting at.) That was the \"straw that broke the camel's back\" for me. We paid out and went to Darcy McGees (in the same shopping center) where the staff are always pleasant and helpful.  We have since given the Lion two more tries but been severely disappointed with the service. The food is excellent- but just cannot make up for the terrible service. The second time we tried this place we sat at the main bar (as to not inconvenience the bartender at the outside bar) and all of the bartenders were too busy talking amongst themselves to notice that both of us were empty on drinks and hungry with no menus offered to us. I'm sorry to say that we won't be giving this place another shot.
pos	I really enjoyed my mani/pedi with Trisha!  She took her time and taught me about manicuring my nails from home which I loved.  I went in for the Groupon basic mani/pedi deal and left feeling like I got a lot more! It was the most pleasant experience I've had at a nail salon. The conversation was easy and Trish is a great person. I will be coming back to Trish for nails again!   The entire staff was friendly and professional. Great Salon!!
neg	The worse food and service. I have never given a bad review. I ordered a shrimp dish with brown rice. The waiter brought out white rice. The sauce was horrible and bland. The calamari salad was not fresh. The dressing was bland too. The waitress checked on us and we asked for check immediately.  She never asked if anything was wrong or if the food was good. I would never recommend or eat here again. The service and food was horrible. I was visiting from out of town and was hoping to get a new experience.  This was not it...
pos	Mister Softee is an all-star he showed up on time provided great service and has great tasting ice cream... Give him a call !!
neg	I was going to take the time to write a scathing review but I honestly can't even bring myself to do it. 1 star. That's all I can say.
pos	Awesome food anyone??? Go check out Modern Steak in Scottsdale AZ. Gorgeous dining room! Excellent service (with our server Gabe)! And the food was AAAMMMAZZING!  It's located at Fashion Mall but it's NOT a \"mall\" restaurant. A MUST go!
neg	I will never go here again. So disappointed when I went in its a cute store don't get me wrong I would buy so much there for my dog. But the day I went I went to get a treat for my dog for his birthday. The lady was on her phone the whole time talking personal business while my mother and I stood they're waiting for her to get off or put the person on hold. All we wanted to do was to ask her to get that dog cookie for us. So after 10 minutes of waiting we decided to leave and while walking out the door the lady shouted thanks for coming. That pissed me off cause she put down the phone to say bye but not to get an actual freaking sale. I'll continue going to to petsmart. Tried to support a local business but I guess when you own your own place you can have poor customer service
pos	Dude...a happy hour that is TRULY happy!!!    This joint is relatively swank for all the deals it has.  Nice decor good bar FRESH seafood (seriously...this is some good quality).  Starting at 4:00 p.m. they have $5 martinis AND $0.75 oysters.  YUM!  On top of that they offer discounts on other appetizers such as the bread and cheese plate a GIANT crab cake a salads and shrimp dishes.  All are tasty.  For all the Zoners out there (yeah I said it) you have to check out this place.  You will have a great time!   NOTE - beware of dirty old men.  They'll hit on your friends!
neg	Horrible service. Barely acknowledged when you first walked in. Slow service and waited for my check for 20 minutes before getting up to go get it myself. Will not come again.
pos	So my friend and I stumbled upon this place on our way to Barb's bakery but WOW I have never had a better taco in my life. The carne asada street tacos are freaking amazing. They also have the bottled cokes from mexico that for some reason taste sweeter than cokes bottled here. The waitress was also extremely friendly when we were checking out we asked how to pronounce the name of the restaurant and she started teaching us some Spanish.
neg	I learned of this company through a living social deal. I emailed them to set up an appointment. The earliest available date was a month later I went ahead and scheduled the appointment in spite of the wait time. One month went by  on the scheduled day of cleaning in which I was told they would arrive between 12 and 1... NO ONE shows up. I wait at 3:30 I email asking why was this scheduled appointment not kept?... I've yet to get a response or an explanation.  There are many cleaning companies out there my suggestion - try a different one than Maid 4 it all.
pos	I can now thank the Humane Society for not only giving me my dog Brutus when I was a child but now my dog Harley as an adult. A couple of years ago I planned a visit to the Arizona Humane Society to present them with a corporate donation on behalf of my old company. When I scheduled the meeting they offered to give me a tour of the vicinity and as a friend of the helpless animals I said of course and planned my visit. However I knew that with a tour I might be in some trouble in the willpower department.   When I arrived to the center I was greeted by a pretty view of South Mountain and a wide open vicinity. I walked inside and immediately noted how clean it was for being home to many a furry creature. The staff was warm and welcoming as potential new \"parents\" waited in the lobby to adopt a new friend. Kittens and bunnies greeted the guests and there was a special area for the cats being featured that week. The vicinity was a five star facility to say the least and I could immediately tell that the animals were treated well here and in good hands until they found a new home.   To make a long story shorter they gave us a detailed tour of the complex. I walked through spacious room after spacious room full of dogs of all kinds just wanting a home. As I walked up to one of the cages a furry ball of fluff looked up at me and placed his paw on the cage. I fell in love immediately. To make matters worse the staff then took us into a room where we could make a kong of peanut butter and treats for our dog of choice. Of course I had to give it to my new found friend. At that point I knew I was in trouble and could very well be leaving with a dog. So to end that part of my story I did leave with a dog and Harley has been happy in his new home ever sense.   While I visited the Humane Society I couldn't get over their quality of service for not only the clients but the animals themselves. They were clean kept in spacious areas and they even had a huge playground for the animals to play in each and every day. When i found Harley and started to think about taking him home with me they took me to a private play area where I could get to know Harley a bit more to make sure he was the right dog for me. A staffer stayed in the area and helped me with any questions I had. When I made the decision to take Harley home with me they neutered him gave me a couple free vet visits and sent me home with some treats food and a leash. They even have a pet store to pick up all your essentials for your new friend. And did I mention that the proceeds go back to the Humane Society...a nonprofit?   This Arizona Humane Society is a five star pet resort that focuses on making the most of a pet's stay until they find a new home. I suggest just taking a visit to the facility to see how well-kept it is. They even have horses that they rescued. Sorry folks they are not up for adoption though. So thank you Arizona Humane Society for bringing my little dog Harley to me and saving so many animals from the streets.
neg	I was there on a Friday night with a few friends in the hopes of a quick drink and nosh after a show next door. My companion and I ordered basic drinks and were met with shots of liquor in the bottoms of our glasses and a blank look from the waitress when I asked if they were out of mixers.  After this we opted not to order any food (taking our cue from the inability to mix gin with tonic water) and were met with an outrageous bill (for our two 'well' shots).  We questioned the tally and were met with a second total that wasn't much better.   Our credit card was charged twice: $40 for some wet ice and a lemon wedge.  There are many cool and artsy places in Phx where we can catch live music and nosh with friends.  I'll pass this one up from now on.
pos	Awesome awesome awesome....everything was fantastic. The innovative drink menu the pizza was out of this world and the bartender was very personable. A++ I would definitely recommend this place to everyone. Ban't wait to return!
neg	Donuts are worst I've ever had. I bought 2 dozen donuts using their 10.99 sale and it was the worst donuts I have ever had in my life. All the donuts were dry and stale. I should have gone a couple of miles over and bought Krispy Kreme. Krispy Kreme donuts are always fresh. These ones were worst that those that sat on the shelf for a week in a supermarket!
pos	Hole-in-the-Rock is a cave-like natural rock formation sculpted into the top of a sandstone butte in Phoenix's beautiful Papago Park. It's one of the most powerful scenic views in our city and is the perfect place to showcase its exquisite landscape. Just a short hike up the butte and you'll find yourself in the amazing chamber sculpted over millions of years of wind and water erosion.   At sunset there are few locations that can rival its awesomeness. The hole faces south giving a wonderful view over south Phoenix all the way to South Mountain.    Hole-in-the-Rock is truly one of the greatest attractions in our city and everyone would be blessed to experience it at least once.   No fee to enter. Bring a camera!
neg	Is it illegal to have good Chinese good in Arizona?  We went tonight having high hopes of having high quality fresh Chinese food and we were sorely disappointed.:(  We opened our take out bag and the white rice had been left off of the order...we were going to give them a pass for that...but on the flavor issue...there are no excuses...  The Peeking Dumplings were wilted and flavorless.  The sauce that went with them could not revive them.  The Chinese mustard was in little packets and had no heat...Viagra needed:(!  The Mongolian Beef was so salty it tasted processed.  The snap peas were stringy and overcooked.  The General Chow's Chicken...it tasted old like it was off an all you can eat buffet.  Honestly...Panda Express is better...as least you know what to expect in a mall food court.  It wasn't cheap...and I'm not a food volume person but the portions were small...I was fine with it because who would want more of this plate of shame!  I hope they can get there act together...but I fear the owner may be in over his head...  Isn't there a Chinese Chef in town who needs  a job!
pos	Flatiron Mesa is one of my favorite hikes in the Phoenix area. Like other reviewers have stated once you've gotten used to Squaw and Camelback give this one a try.  It'll kick your ass.  It's about a 2600' climb in elevation so you're doing more like 2.5 Camelbacks. You'll be scrambling over boulders most of the way up since there really aren't switchbacks. I'd say give yourself about 5 hours to go up and down.  It's inside Lost Dutchman State Park so you will need to pay an entry fee.  My one recommendation besides the obvious ones (being fit pack food and water) is to bring some light gloves.  Since you're climbing up and down on all those boulders your hands will probably get a little scratched up.  Don't feed the wildlife.
neg	There are few resources in Arizona for dancers actors and performers so it's best to order online if you have the time to wait for shipping. Dee's Dancewear is overpriced and because they know they are the only game in town their customer service (and return policies) have suffered. In an emergency situation you're better suited going to Mischa's Dancewear on 33rd Ave and Bell or Capezio's in Scottsdale. Otherwise order online and steer clear of this establishment when possible.
pos	I've been going to Lake Pleasant Dentistry for 2-3 years now and Dr. Sharon Bader is hands-down the best dentist I've ever had.  I've traditionally had bad experiences with dentists and am always wary of any dental procedure but I've never felt more comfortable than with Dr. Bader.  She is very accommodating puts you at ease explains all the options and does GREAT work and will stand behind it.  She did a pretty complex crown for me when the tooth was borderline whether it could be saved and it worked out great.  I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this practice to anyone.
neg	This review is based solely on service - not the food.   I am sitting in a booth at RA as I type this - that is how upset I am with the host staff at ra. I called ahead to inform the restaurant that we would have a party of 8. When we arrived the girls at the front were so rude I almost walked out. We waited 35 min for our table and the entire time the host staff was looking my entire group up and down giving us the \"stink eye\". I am sorry that you are 18 years old work for $8 and have a stick up your butt but do not make us feel unwelcome. My girlfriend and I went to the back to use the bathroom - the host followed us back and asked us what we were doing - not to help us find the bathroom but just to be a snob. From here on out ra is ruined for me.
pos	What happened to this place?  The food was good and seemed to have passionate folks who worked there.  What a shame!  I think many were only just discovering it.
neg	I have never been treated so rudely in a retail establishment ever. I went to the shop with my daughter her friend and my niece...all young adults. I showed a picture of the project we wanted make to the woman working there and she scoffed at me.  I noticed she was playing Solitaire on her iPad...apparently we interrupted her game. She then proceeded to tell us that she would have to open the door and turn on the air conditioner because her mother the owner of the store would be back soon and is extremely allergic to fragrance.  The girls and I had body lotion on this is the desert for crying out loud and not one of us had perfume on.  Then the mother arrived there was a brief conversation behind the curtain and she walk out with a towel over her mouth and nose commenting on having to open the door. Seriously? Unfortunately we had picked out some stuff to buy and I'm sorry that I spent the $68. I could have spent more but the experience was so distasteful that we hurried out. If I knew how to give less than 1 star I would. It was unbelievable. I empathize with the woman and her allergies but the situation could have been handled so much better.
pos	Pleasant courteous  low prices and your clothes are ready the next day! What more could you ask for!
neg	I don't think anyone who gave over a 2 has ever eaten Italian food in Chicago.   I struggled to give 2 stars but figured the wings were decent .  #1) No celery salt on the Dog #2) No cucumber on the Dog #3) WORST OF ALL the GYRO was not off a spit it was processed #4) Also living 30 years in Chicago I have never had a gyro covered in more lettuce than there were onioins.  #5) Since when does a Gyro (not in Chicago) have Feta Cheese & almost not Tatziki #6) The PIZZA IS NOT CHICAGO STYLE ITS 100\% New York #7) Wings are a 6 out of 10 #8) THERE IS NO DEEP DISH PIZZA OFFERED OR THICK CRUST??? #9) I apologize they have now gone from 2 to 1 star...   PLEASE CHANGE YOUR NAME YOU\"RE A DISGRACE TO CHICAGO!!!  Don't think I will give this place another shot no reason
pos	It's pretty awesome here!  I was traveling in Phoenix for work and had to get my raw food fix (I eat a raw diet at home and as much as I can while traveling) and this was excellent!  The portions were large and the price was good.  The same type of food in places like Chicago are much more expensive.  I got the raw taco's for lunch and the blueberry fields salad to-go.  They were both great!  I also had an appetizer but that ended up being too much food so I packed it too.  The location is actually fairly close to the airport (10 min drive) and so it will be my preferred place to go when I'm in Phoenix.
neg	Let me preface this review ..I have lived in this area for 15 years and Chompie's has been the only option for good Jewish deli. In my 51 years I have never received worse service than from Chompie's They ALWAYS get the order wrong. Tonight after much debate I caved for my daughter who has strep throat. She wanted nothing else but matzah ball soup to make her feel better. So reluctantly I called in for take out at Chompies. I assumed the one thing on there menu that might be a safe bet and hard to screw up would be the soup. I returned home and called my daughter in to tell her I got what the doctor ordered. As I watched her pour it in the bowl we noticed it was missing one key ingredient......... THE SOUP!!!!!  When I decided to call and tell Chompies this has to be the 10th or 12 time in a row they have screwed up our order. This was more than screwing up a order. This was forgetting the soup in SOUP. They told me if I wanted the broth I should have asked for it in a separate container. I responded I didn't think I had to ask for broth in soup! I WILL NEVER GIVE THEM A DIME OF MY MONEY AGAIN.  I highly recommend to drive the additional 15-20 minutes in your car and find somewhere else when looking for jewish comfort food. You will be highly disappointed with Chompies. This is the first time I have ever heard of yelp. My son told me to come on here because this is a way to tell other people to avoid restaurants such as these. I hope you take my advice.
pos	Went here for the first time a few weeks ago and it was some of the best BBQ I've had in Arizona.   The service was great as well! The manager stopped by a few times as well as our waiter to make sure everything was good.  *****UPDATE*****  Looks like they went out of business. Haven't been open for two weeks now.....
neg	Brought a group to Metro for brunch made the reservation a month ago called three days ago to update and ask to be outside and people arrived and were told there was no reservation. Finally spoke with the manager and had that sorted out but when I asked for our tables outside and they couldn't accommodate.   Having the bartender wait on a party of 18 was idiotic. Not enough menus slow horrible drinks no silverware soup was burnt-how do you burn soup??? Attempting to fix the situation with beignets was a nice attempt until we heard the server swearing about having to deal with us.   I host events all over the valley and never have I experienced service as horrible as I did at Metro.   They have recently changed management unfortunately the great reviews I read when I made the reservation don't hold true anymore.  Update 11/8/2010 Since my first review I received a $50 gift certificate from the management of Metro.  I decided to go for dessert last Friday night with 5 of my friends.  I knew I couldn't just go with one other person it had to be a group to show what they could do.    We arrived at 9:15 and were seated on the patio.  I met the general manager and she was pleasant enough I never saw her again.  There was no one seated inside and the patio was half full.  Jesse greeted us and was the most attentive and understanding server when two guests needed to return their drinks to the bar because they were not made properly - it was a specialty drink from their cocktail menu.  We ordered beignets apple bread pudding and triple chocolate delight.  The beignets and apple bread pudding were good.  The triple chocolate delight had absolutely no chocolate flavor at all.  Jesse was by far an excellent server and if you go ask to be seated in his section.
pos	I went in at 8 on a Thursday night and the place was pretty empty except for a family of 4 eating.  The layout is a little strange it looks like you should order at the big window with the kitchen behind it but you actually order in the back right corner of the restaurant.  The girl who took my order was very friendly and made my fat ass feel welcome there which is pretty rare these days.  She suggested I do the slider plate which I did with a side of green chili mac and cheese and cornbread.  It took about 10 minutes for my order to come out which is probably a good sign that they were at least spending some time cooking something back there.  The sliders were awesome all the meat was very moist and full of smoky flavor my favorite out of the three was definitely the pulled pork.  The green chili mac and cheese was also very good which was somewhat surprising to me.  I was expecting Stouffer's with pickled jalapenos stirred in but it was far from that.  For being the end of the night it was very fresh and cheesy.  The only part of the meal that wasn't great was the cornbread but I don't think you can really do much to cornbread to make it wow you anyway.  I definitely like this better than Honey Bears and it doesn't even compare to the BBQ joke Famous Dave's.  When I have tailgate this year Andrew's will definitely be my go to place for everything.  Also my meal only ran me about $8.50 and it was very filling and worth every penny.
neg	4 stars for the place itself and it's food/coffee. 0 stars for the service or lack there of.  My business partner and I were in town for a convention.  We heard we should check out Lola.  So we did.  We were excited.  The lady (I use the term loosely here) who took our order was LESS than patient OR helpful.  We asked a few questions.  She barely answered us then when we had to repeat the question she was nothing short of annoyed.  An example.  We asked where we could get a glass or cup of water.  She mumbled something about the bar/table.  My partner walked over and saw no cups.  She came back and asked where the cups were.  On the table came an exasperated retort.  I walked over to inspect for myself.  There were no cups on the table.  So I kindly asked her if the cups should be on the table if so there appeared to be none.  She said they are on the table but *sigh* I'll go check but I know they're there!  10 seconds later she comes out of the kitchen with a tube of cups.  IMAGINE THAT the customer was right.  I watched this lady serve other customers.  It appears that regulars are treated with a smile and courtesy and patience.  Newcomers or people she doesn't like are treated worse than the dirt on the bottom of her shoes.  My suggestion to management adjust her attitude or get rid of her!  She is not good for business.
pos	Service is always great and the waiters are plesant and nice to have serve you.  This is one of my favorite breweries to come too.  They have a good selection of beer that is made in house and you can also get a growler of any type to take home (or home made root beer which is also amazing)  I have never had anything less than a great meal in the around 60 times I have ate here.
neg	I never knew green chilies were more valuable than gold. We ordered a dozen red tamales and a dozen green chilies. The person taking our order was not happy that we did not give them a 24 hour notice that their \"gourmet tamales\" require for such a large order. The red tamales were as dry as sawdust and the green chilies came with one small sliver of chili. The \"hot Sauce\" they have is nothing more than enchilada sauce with red chili flake added. Next time I'll just go to Del Taco where two dozen .40 cent tacos do not require a 24 hr notice from a family of 6.
pos	Great little restaurant.  The staff is super friendly and their happy hour specials are pretty amazing.  I got thePanko crusted Tipalia which was a little dry but my girlfriend's stuffed mahi mahi was delicious.  The Horchata bread pudding was really good too.  They have a nice patio where most of the customers sit I will be bringing my dog with me next time.    It is a bit expensive so be prepared to drop some money but it's definitely worth checking out.
neg	Worst store in the chain - I agree with one poster that it's not crowded but it also is out of items more than any other store.  It also is so understaffed it's impossible to get help if you need it and if you ask someone that works here that you finally locate my experience is that they wont know what your asking for anyway.  I recently was in the store asking about a certain item by Susan Lenart Kazmer the person looked right at me and said oh we don't carry that artist you might try hobby lobby they get a little credit for trying to help but Susan's line is a Michaels only item.  I gave the woman the line name and said no we don't carry that I'm sure.  I pointed at the huge display in front of me of Susan items and her answer Oh that must be brand new.  I said nope it came out three years ago now can you see if you have this specific item she said oh we can't do that and she walked off talking to her friend the only other employee in the store that i had seen.   Ok bad but any store can have a bad employee right.  so I go up to pay a pleasant young girl asks me if I have a Michael's card?  I say sure do and hand it to her.  Oh that's not a Michaels card ours are red.  I explain that it's a gold card for people who spend more money and that as a professional artist I'm there quite a bit.  She says I've never heard of that before.  Well it's a Michaels card just read the front it says Michaels right there.  she stands looking at me so I said try scanning it I promise it will work.  She scans it and then says oh it says you have a $5  off coupon loaded on this card.  My response;  good you get a five dollar coupon for every 100 you spend.  Now she looks scared and says the dreaded words I'm not sure  let me call the manager.  So 20 minutes go by and who shows up the lady that argued about the Susan Lenart items.  They finally agree to try it and I'm finally out the door just 40 minutes later.  And that's not even the bad part!   I went into this store to have something framed that was three weeks ago they tell me every day it will be the next day all to no avail they use every excuse imaginable custom frames take time or custom mat colors are hard to get.   Each time I explain it's a off the shelf frame there only cutting a black mat.  they say oh that should be fast will have it tomorrow.    I wouldn't shop here again if it was all free this store is a joke just keep driving and go to the large store at Power and McKellip's it's a much larger store with competent staff and about twice the selection.   It's well worth the drive and the cost of gas I live less than two miles from the gateway store and can still drive make my purchases and drive home much faster than trying to shop at the local gateway store.  They have even  framed two other items while I'm still waiting for the Gateway store to cut a simple mat.
pos	The best bar in town.
neg	Bleh.  Most of us have ventured to the rock at some point in time. It has always been quite awful but I had some hope after new ownership took over and renovated the place. It is always sad to see a place that has potential be complete crap.  Upon walking in we were greeted by a small room used as a bar area with random bar tables along the side. And whales. And scary looking people. And a DJ...well...kinda...he was playing music from a computer..you know...like you would so at home.  We ordered two beers and sat down. Why not give it a chance right? Just when we thought that things couldn't get worse we heard a sound. Like a squealing sound. Yes you guess right horrible karaoke ON A FRIDAY NIGHT!?!?! Why God why?????  We chugged our beers and left.
pos	I' m psycho for this place.  The sell cupcakes now! (Ollie Cake)  and have longer hours of operations I believe ( I want to say until 7?)  NOM NOM NOM.
neg	Had to eat here with coworkers for lunch today and was incredibly disappointed. My $8 caesar salad was probably the tiniest I've ever had. Service was slow the entire table was nearly finished before mine arrived and staff was unapologetic. I've had side salads larger than the full salad they served me for lunch. Overall a miserable experience and I won't be back.
pos	Lived in house for 9 years and just thought was time to replace the carpeting had used some of those \"$99 room\" services over the years for routine cleaning met Ray Odom Owner of Hydro-Pro and gave them a crack at cleaning the carpets before I replaced them. I was Amazed at results by the time they were done the carpets looked brand new took their time and did incredibally throrugh job.  Great service at reasonable price-well worth it. My carpet cleaner from now on.
neg	Slowest DRIVE THRU ever!!!! Also the quintessential SHORT BUS Location.  I frequented this location around dinner time since it is the closest to my home a few times and every time it is between a 10-15 min ordeal. When i worked at Mickey D's in the early 90's we had what was called 90 sec HBO( Hand Bag Out) from order to picking up should be no longer than 90 secs. This must not be a practiced any longer.  I have to say hello when I drive up to the speaker due to getting no response. Then I get someone who is rude and say's yes. I order the big mac deal buy 1 get 1 for a $1. The employee says they do not offer that I advise their menu out front does. After 5 min of silence and cars backing up I pull fwd to make sure he is still living to see what is up. Total lack of cust serv service he had to have the mgr show him how to ring it up no apology or anything. This happened each time I went there. C'mon man
pos	Let me start by saying that I love tacos. I eat lots of tacos. When I get hungry one of the first things to cross my mind is tacos. That said I love El Nopalito for their tacos. I'm pretty picky about my tacos. I don't really like dumb-ass flour tortillas dry tacos unseasoned meat in a taco taco bell is not tacos the list goes on. I prefer authentic Mexican street tacos.  That being said El Nopalito is the one place in town I feel like I am getting the most authentic street taco that I have been able to find in Phoenix. The only reason I am not here more often is the commute is a bit much as I live in the East Valley.  However if I am anywhere near the area it is almost mandatory to stop and have at least a taco or two. I recommend trying all of the tacos though my favourite has to be the cabeza (it sounds creepy but is buttery and delicious).  It does help if you speak Spanish as it will make ordering and asking any questions you may have easier.
neg	Beware... use only a credit card so you can stop payment if you need to. ( our sales person encouraged us to pay cash and get a 10\% discount ).  Big mistake  Any problem you're on your own...really... On your own!  We've spent over $3000 at this store and it has been a nightmare.  Delivery took  weeks longer then our sales person said & our paper work indicated. There was a mistake with the fabric the paint was mismatched what was to take 10 days took 3 months.  Not a darn thing was handled properly.  Every call we made to \"customer service\" was routed directly  back to our  sales person. We went back to the store  in person but there is no mgr no one except commission sales staff and a voice mail merry go round.
pos	This place is heavenly!!! I have dreams about it on a regular basis. The cookies are so fresh and you can choose two different kinds and two different ice cream flavors. TASTY!
neg	Received two more messages from \"Iolanda\" this morning.  Thought some of you might get a kick out of reading them.  I'm definitely never going back to 98 South.  Hope this info helps some of you...  BTW don't you just love orangeheads??  Doling out insults are so much easier when hiding behind a mask!  19 minutes ago: Obviously rebuttal is not your friend but jealously is your neighbor......  9 minutes ago: Thought the drink was for your gentleman friend but your the one that had to abandoned it.....You really shouldn't have your picture posted ......pug!!! I mean easy target....Lets go west side .............yeppie!!!
pos	Yum best donuts in Phoenix.
neg	Totally excited to try this place out my grandparents my mom and I (4 of us) came here for some Korean food. It wasn't too busy; just pairs of people from nearby offices coming in and out.   Unlike other Korean restaurants their lunch special selection is very limited. Special A  consists of a sushi roll with a soda special B = teriyaki beef/chicken (no soda) or special C Korean BBQ Spicy Chicken.   As we were looking at the \"lunch special\" board the lady behind the counter insisted that we should look at their full price menu instead. Here comes the awkward part: she then asked my mom \"are you Chinese?\" Even though she is my mum looked at me all puzzled as in \"what does that mean?\" The lady proceeded by pointing at the \"seafood pancake\" section on the menu and saying \"I don't know why but you Chinese like this pancake a lot.\" Good thing my mom didn't hear what she said.. or else...   So we got the Spicy Chicken lunch special ($6.99) a bulgogi ($6.99) and a beef yakisoba ($7.19). The cool thing about this place is that it has a mini \"kimchi\" buffet bar with trays of marinated tofu potato bean sprout kimchi broccoli and some other vegetables. It also has this delicious house special hot sauce.   By the time we finished a dish of kimchi the food came so it didn't take long. The spicy chicken came in a bowl about the size of an instant-noodle bowl (but slightly deeper) was tender with rice underneath it. The chicken was definitely marinated well; however the last couple of pieces had tendons and big chunks of fat... what a bad way to end it. The bulgogi also came in a bowl with rice underneath. The beef was definitely not marinated fully. The color was super light and the beef was close to tasteless. The biggest disappointment food-wise was the beef yakisoba. The noodles occupying most of the Styrofoam lunch box were sweet. Then there was an ice-cream scoop of rice topped with 3 pieces I kid you not THREE pieces of dog-tag-sized super-dry meat.   In the end we just decided to bring the barely-touched yakisoba home for my younger brother (well teenage boys tend to eat everything...). While my mom transfered the noodles to the plastic bowl (since the Styrofoam box was lidless) I went to ask for a plastic cover. This is the best part: the same lady stared at me pointed at the salad bar and said \"you can't take that home\". I thought there was a miscommunication so I asked again for a lid for the noodles. Again she pointed at the salad bar and said \"you are not allowed to take the kimchi home\". Wow seriously? Just b/c my grandparents are Chinese you assumed we were stashing kimchi in a bowl and trying to sneak it out? \"Look I just want to take my noodles home ok?\" She hesitantly gave me a lid.  \"Hey hey you. we chineness peple no steal kimchi becuz Confucius say 'no stealing kimchi'\"... only if I said that to her face...  Oh and when we got home my brother aka our food dumpster took a bite of the yakisoba and never touched it again.    Conclusion: If you want amazing Korean food and friendly customer service please just go to Chodang. Chodang is WAYYY BETTER hands down
pos	Alright we are going to say that this place is Awesome!  The service is outstanding and the food wonderful!    We came here for Breakfast on Sunday Morning .             They were very busy but we did not have to wait too long at all.                                    Our server Colleen was great!   She greeted us right away and  brought our drinks very quickly.   The food was very good and just love their Potatoes.  The menu is fantastic! Lots to choose from. We like the decor and lots of parking in the lot. Nice Place and we will be back!
neg	3 months 22 emails 10 plus calls and (I think) we have the final refund from Budget!  Stay clear of Budget Rental they DO NOT care about customers or resolving their monumental mistakes!
pos	This place is a gem. The food is amazing. It's cheap. The service is good. My favorite part? The place never changes. I can walk through the door and Ali already knows my order. The Chicken Shawarma special comes with their hand-made pita - so soft and delicious. The chicken is seasoned perfectly and comes with a yummy little dollop of garlic sauce. I've never found better hummus in my life. I've had it all around town in New York in L.A. (ick...L.A. *shudder*). SO good! The iced tea has a hint of rose water. OH and the gyro? Hands down the best in town.  Did I mention they have a market attached? Talk about the best price on spices in town! The spices come in little plastic sealed pillows so get some spice jars from Ikea and stock up!  I couldn't get through this without mentioning the lamb tongue. I am no connoisseur of organ meats but this sandwich is like the most tender lamb you've ever had in your life. Shut up and try it.  The only sad part about Haji's is that they close early. Usually 8pm on a week-night but totally worth getting to-go orders if you can swing in on your way home from work!
neg	This place was horrible! I will never go back it was over priced and the best thing I ate was the corn bread you get  before the meal.  I had the chorizo stuffed tenderlion it was like chewing on a piece of rubber stuffed with soy. My girl freind had  flavorless tacos with stale corn tortillas. three  words it sucked sucked sucked!
pos	We decided to eat here on a whim. My husband got the burger brûlée and I got the beach house burger. Both were fantastic. The buns were perfect and we both agreed these were the best burgers we had had in a really long time. The sweet potato tater tots and French fries were also amazing. For $27 it fed our family of five. I'm definitely going back. Friendly service casual atmosphere and clean. Thumbs up all the way!
neg	This place is over priced and the service is horrible. I went there with my feiends and the server was very rude and degrading!
pos	I have lived steps away from this place for years and a few months ago my boyfriend suggested I give it a try. Since I'm very picky with mexican food places I had doubts but boy was I wrong! All I can say is wow!!! This place is amazingly delicious. I thought I would never find a place who served authentic Mexican tacos and out of the blue I found it in a hole in the wall strip mall and just steps from my house! This can be a good thing but also a dangerous thing because I am trying to lose weight.    This place is so good. I got two tacos and I know I will be going back again and again.
neg	DON'T GET TIFFANY UNLESS YOU WANT A SPEEDY EXPERIENCE Pretty Nail tale with Tiffany- My 10 year old first mani/pedi 4:35 water and feet in chair only 13 minutes and painting toes. Prepped and painted fingernails from the chair- in 20 minutes. 35 minutes in all. Told owner I was unhappy and she said that a kid mani/pedii was 35 minutes then later 35 to 45 minutes. Tiffany never let it dry between coats so when she sat her under the light she told her only 5 more minutes and I stopped her. She said only the under coats will be wet and the top will be dry. I told her Really because you never even let it dry between coats.  She said not 4 coat. Base 2 color and top is 4 ... well top and base dry fast she said...Owner said\" fast or slow it doesn't matter as long as the polish looks good and it looks good.\" I didn't tip her on purpose...not because I'm poor- I got poor service. I would expect this for a color change but not a spa pedicure/manicure.  Very disappointed.  You'd think the owners would realize that all the other patrons saw her take advantage of us.  Get anyone but Tiffany unless you want a quick job!
pos	One of my favorite places to go with the kids for lunch.  Bring a small amount of $ - grab yourself a table under the trees and enjoy the afternoon away while your kids play within eyesight.  The entire \"patio\" is really a large fenced grassy tree filled area with 2 volleyball courts multiple gathering areas ping pong horse shoes jumbo checkers and even another fenced in area full of sand and toys for the kids.
neg	I parked in the Parking Garage got my parking ticket validated and still owed money for parking.  The parking validation was worth $3.00.  The charge for parking was $5.00 with $2.00 credit for the validation (not the $3.00 I was promised).  I paid the remaining $3.00 charge but then the machine wouldn't give me a receipt.  I am never going back to this location.  It is off my radar from now on.
pos	Love this place. Great Happy Hour.
neg	$8 for a tiny sandwich with one egg two greasy strips of bacon and a stale muffin. They say it's pricy because they get it local? It has to have substance to be considered anything. So whack.
pos	Dr. Jones was very friendly and understanding!
neg	I heard good things about this place and was looking forward to what the \"basement\" atmosphere would feel like lowbrow a little seedy etc. Sadly too many middle-aged men wearing flip flops out on a Friday night. Flip flops? UGH..in Winter? Also our waiter SUCKED! He acted like he had a hard night and was unwilling to suggest a beer so I am sure he spit in my draft...Anyhoo does not matter as I will not return.
pos	Great library...take your canned food to donate all during APRIL and they wave off your fines- GREAT cause GREAT deal and now fine free!
neg	Place is alright but for the waitress poor service and things sent over we didn't order.  We sent them back but had  additional items brought and not brought on the tab anyway.  She said me \"that couldn't happen\" and refused to take it off. Waitress included autograt.   I have been here a dozen times and never get great service but enjoy myself.  This time will be my last.
pos	I have been meaning to stop in but keep driving on by.  I am SO GLAD that I stopped. I was pleased the moment I walked in.  The store is well lit and cheery the books line the wall making you feel like you're walking into a oasis of knowledge.  I found 10 copies of the book I was looking for (I needed 10 copies) and the owner said he will order me copies of two books he didn't have.  Also he offered his community room for my book club!  So nice very friendly definitely the kind of place we want to encourage.
neg	The staff is friendly. But the physical hotel itself itself is comparable to a 2 star motel. The Holiday Express I stayed at is better than this. Priceline tricked me when I requested for a 4 star and indicated that this was a 4 star in name your own price.  Cons: 1) They have cactus in the parking lot where when I got home late it was dark poorly lit lot and opened my car door step out of the car and step on to cactus severely injuring my foot to where I can not walk anymore. Who puts low cactus in a dimly lit parking lot where when you get out of a car someone can step on it? Being injured on vacation is no fun and very painful! 2) hotel room and property is old like from the 1980s though the front desk boy told me that the rooms were newly renovated 3) Given the previous reviews I asked for a quiet room but was given a room where the squeeking and thumping and wall shaking woke me up at 5 in the morning. The neighbors flushing the toilet showering and running water can all be heard. 4) the bathroom door is so jammed that it requires both hands all of my body wait and a few minutes of wrestling with it to open/close it 5) Requested a single bed however upon arrival was told that it would be 30/extra a night for a single bed instead of 2 doubles 6) 80s style tube TV  7) pink 80s decor 8) worn down bed with body dent in it 9) wifi costs 9.99/for 24 hours even though its signal is only 1 bar 10) AC blasts loudly on and off during the night 11) curtains are cut half way so tons of light comes in to the room in the morning.   pros:  1) location 2) staff smiles and says hi 3) cleaning staff does a good job
pos	The best gluten free pizza!! Absolutely loved the avacado pizza. So delicious. The wait staff was great very friendly and invited us to a wine tasting while we waited.  Parking is limited but certainly not an issue to complain about.
neg	I haven't yelped in about 2 months and I was waiting for a place to either wow me or disgust me.  Well this place was that bad.   First impressions were all right -- the outside bar was neat w/ good views of downtown and the fire pits were nice.  No beers on tap though; and seriously what's with the hip-hop club DJ at 7:00 pm?  Come on guys way too early for that.  It wasn't too long before three of us were seated; and after about 10 minutes our waitress came up and asked us whether we were ready to ... oh wait that's right no menus yet good job.  O.k. so I ordered the Thai Spring rolls which had a filling of lettuce a single strip of carrot and noodles.  Seriously?!  Main course I ordered the curry which turned out to be the worst curry in the world -- I don't even know if it was curry; it was more like a bowl of thick yellow soup with a few pieces of chicken and a couple of vegetables tossed in.  Yuck.  And then they only gave me a tiny bowl of rice.  I'm sorry isn't it supposed to be the other way around?  My friends completely agreed with how bad the place was (I think they had some sort of stir fry which they said was bland and pointless).  So yeah I don't recommend this place.  Instead head a block over to The Roosevelt for some good beer on tap and some pretty good food.
pos	I went in to check out the new drop of denim that the boys at The Phoenicia Association got in and left with a new pair of Naked and Famous Raw Selvedge Denim Weird Guy cut; and a shirt by Wrath Arcane with the sickest little pocket that drops from your breast to your waist (perfect for my lighter and cigs) with a little zipper at the bottom. Spent a nice chunk of dough but nothing crazy for such a nice combo I can wear to dinner with the parents or to Old Town/Downtown on a Saturday night.
neg	I was not impressed. The food was bad & expensive. The wait is ridiculous. Don't go.
pos	The best food I have found the area and the price is right.  You get so much food you have to take home.  Get there early to get a good seat fills up for lunch.  Priced just right.
neg	This was the best camera/photography store in the valley.  It has now been re-imagined and renamed as Photomart upon its move to Scottsdale.  I recently visited the new location...and I was shocked!  The store was extremely small had very little to sell (I didn't even see a camera on display).  They did carry some glass...but mostly a very small selection of accessories.  I didn't even recognize any of the former employees.    I encourage all the former loyal Photomark customers to visit Photomart.  I'm sure you will leave disappointed.  Two thumbs down to this lemon!
pos	I love breweries and I love Four Peaks. One of e best breweries in Az. We came here on a Friday night but had no trouble getting a table. This place is huge and packed but still room to move around. We ordered the Hopshot IPA which is a great beer!  I've been here a few time and always had a good experience. I can't wait till the pumpkin porter coming Oct 1st!!!
neg	It's a good concept if the owners / mismanagement had bothered to keep a trendy or classy atmosphere. As it is save your money get fast food - McDonald's has less grease. We had to ask for plates for the appetizer platter (it is meant to be shared) so the sever handed my daughter 4 paper plates.   My salad wasn't a salad it was a paper plate of mixed greens - really no tomatoes nothing on it or in it other than lettuce and she threw a packet of Newmans Dressing on the table just like the ones you get at Burger King or McDonald's. My steak - it was OK - I asked for medium and got medium well and that was the best part of it. The steak is served on a paper plate and when I asked about utensils I was directed to go get my own from around the corner - yup plastic ware for a steak on a paper plate.  My daughter had a burger and it was so greasy the bun turned soggy brown part way through then fell completely apart.  Service? Well let's just pretend this place is 100\% do it yourself then it would be OK. The waitress walked away before my daughter finished her order. Never came back and asked how things were nothing. Really if we were the kind to dine & dash it wouldn't have been a problem because she wouldn't have known we were gone. My daughter actually had to go find the server and ask for the bill!!!!  What kills me is the employees exude an I don't care attitude which is also obvious in their actions (or lack of actions) and the message I got was the owner / mis-management has accepted this lazy unfriendly service because it's obvious by how poorly the place is run that it's OK with them.  It could be great but they would need to make a lot of changes - job 1 fire everyone & start over. If I could have given them 1/2 a star I would have - we won't be going back.
pos	Great service by Angela and their Doc First time I don't have to wear reading glasses as they switched me to a mono contact Very enjoyable experience and very quick Had a issue with a contact and they track a replacement done right away Definitely recommend
neg	Let me first say that we are fans of the W Hotel and have stayed in many of their hotels around the nation and are overall happy with the accommodations and customer service.    I'm a local Phoenician who resides in the Arcadia neighborhood and frequents many of the wonderful restaurants and hotels this City has to offer.  After hearing MANY negative reviews from co-workers family and friends my fiancé and I decided to give the W Hotel Scottsdale a shot prior to forming an opinion of our own for this hotel/restaurant/bar.  During a night out on the town with visiting and local friends we opted to give this place a try.  Upon approaching the entrance of the bar security tells us that we're not welcome here due to one of the members of our party not having closed toe shoes and another not having a collared shirt.  The attire our group was wearing was more than appropriate for any Phoenix/Scottsdale restaurant/bar.  Let me remind you that's is July in Phoenix and over one-hundred degrees at the time of night we went to the W and the six of us just finished a dinner at an adjacent popular restaurant.  The staff was flat out rude to not only us but others in line wanting and willing to spend money and support the local hotel.  I will strongly suggest not staying here or supporting the quality of business they are running here.  During a time of a slowing economy and tourism many businesses are forced to rely solely on the best possible customer service to attract and retain business--the W Hotel fell way short of this.  I was very discouraged after our experience here and will agree with the many other reviewers that this place in not worth supporting.    Phoenix/Scottsdale has many great places to experience so don't settle for this place.
pos	My wife and I finally tried CPH and were greatly surprised by everything.  The food as expected was superior along with the professionalism of the staff.  The ambiance too was well set as the place could hold large parties very comfortably.   We began the nigth with a bottle of wine the original chopped salad alons with the rock shrimp.  All were exceptional!  As out main courses my wife orded the sea scallops and I ordered the short ribs.  (Peter of Cowboy Ciao's must miss this guy.)  Both dinners were cooked to perfection and the staff never left alone.  For dessert we had coffee and the evening's special the donut holes with three dipping sauces.  All were fantastic.  The wife and I don't usually rate places with five stars but this place actually gets how food and service are meant to be as one.  Can't wait until we head back.
neg	Worst enchiladas EVER and decor from a 1980's attempt at a mexican restaurant.  Taco Bell is a step up!  But if you like soupy enchiladas drowning in cheez wiz this is the place for you.
pos	Some might say that Phoenix is a city without much culture.  That may be true in some aspect however we have to remember that Phoenix is a young large city compared to other cities that lie within the United States.  So you can say that this city is a work in progress on catching up with everyone's culture expectations.  The Japanese Friendship Garden in downtown Phoenix is only seven years old.  Very new to the park scene for this metro I have to say that it looks great and will only keep getting better in time.  That will happen if people stop saying there is no culture in Phoenix and become a part of the evolving city by visiting places such as this.  The admission and or donations will fund a more desired park for all.  The grounds of the garden are very beautiful with a nice flowing stream several waterfalls coy fish and many species of plants.  I can't wait to go back in the next several years to see it become a wonderful masterpiece.
neg	My part Jewish friend has been raving about this deli so come payday we went to check it out. Ive been in Phoenix a little over a month and have been getting sick from the food here...diarrhea lots shit my pants once... anyway i like to eat in divey non-american cuisine. This place aint seedy enough for me I suppose.  I did not get ill from the food here  However....   $12.95 for a sandwich fries and a dollop of soggy coleslaw ???  I kept hearing from my friend his mom and the waitress that the sandys are HUGE. nope.  Thought we might split one. nope.  My sandwich was flavorless..err..thats a lie.. it tasted like stale bread.  $29.98 for 2 sandwiches and 2 sodas (its an effin sandwich!!!). I only had $40 (only ?)  Left the waitress $5.  Gave my friend the other $5 to put toward a plane ticket to New York where he might experience Kosher (and a bit of his heritage) on a more realistic scale.  ..the fries were good tho.
pos	This is a very special medical practice with customer service and attention to detail that you hardly ever see in a doctor's office anymore. I started seeing Dr. Ross for Osteopathic Manipulation after having a few back surgeries. He has given me tremendous relief and I highly recommend OMT rather than chiropractic treatment since it works with the tissue and muscles as well as the bones. Anyways He listens and takes time to treat your WHOLE body unlike most doctors that have one hand on the door knob as they speak to you.   I saw a Naturopath in the past and saw Cheryl the P.A. for the first time the other day. She took a lot of time with me going through my blood work line by line. I was so please that she suggested supplements and knew about things that I learned from the Naturopath...but actually she knew about more supplements than the Naturopath! So I was really pleased.   This is a great office and everyone is like family....they also treat you like you are a part of their family. They make your children feel comfortable too. There are tons of Mickey Mouse figures and videos for them to watch. The nurses have always loved on my daughter since she was a baby. They make sure that all of us have a productive appointment! I highly recommend this office.
neg	I went here because all my friends were peeing their pants about how good it is. Wrong.  The slow (perhaps retarted) staff with no customer service alongside the barely mediocre tasting pizza both contributed to my disdain for this awful eatery. Fuck it...stick to Slices.
pos	Best prices and a huge selection. I love their single bottles of beer isle where you can mix and match your own 6-pack of beer. Some of my favorite beers I can only find here.
neg	Gross plain and simple!  I'll crave some quick Chinese Food and then I'm always upset.  What a waste of money!
pos	This is the old location. For current reviews look up Karen's Kreamery Cafe'. Here is what I posted for the new location...please give it a chance. I do not know the owners I just love supporting a good local business... Great ice cream super cute store extremely CLEAN! The ice cream is good service is always great and the location is fun (although a little out of the way). The prices are reasonable. I would rather support a locally owned business and pay more than McDonald's prices and less than Cold Stone prices. If you haven't been and plan on visiting in the Summer bring suits for the kids. There is a nice little splash area right next to a big playground. Karen's Kreamery is located in a big park/sports facility. There is also a medium sized skate park. We usually make a fun outing out it. My family loves this place!! Support local businesses!!!
neg	Simply stated..............a GREASY burger from start to finish..  NOT 4 me....This place I will avoid while I continue on to a real good burger joint.!!
pos	All around great food.  True Texas brisket experience.  Meat has great flavor and tasty sides add variety to the offerings.  Don't forget about the sheet cake for dessert!!  I'll be back.    ***Read another review on here talking about wings.  They don't have wings here!!  Get your reviews right people.
neg	I'm very displeased with the service I receive from the Republican party in Arizona.  First they provide us with John McCain.  Then Jan Brewer.  Then they crap SB 1070 all over us which we didn't even vote on.  I've never received anything but lousy politics from these people.
pos	This is my neighborhood Chinese Restaurant and a family staple.  I personaly like the roasted / peking duck.  The Shrimp Lo-Mein is good Fast Friendly Service No MSG. Lunch Specials  during the week are awesome too.
neg	I really enjoy writing reviews praising a place for great food service ambiance and value or any combination of these. Unfortunately this isn't one of those reviews.   This is a fish story... No not about the big one that got away. Nor is it about the time I was fly fishing with my dad and had to rescue him because he stepped in a deep hole and sank when his waders filled with water.... this is about the trout that saved the day.  When my wife and I arrived at the Greene House it was earlier in the evening still happy hour though we were there for dinner not appetizers. Checked-in with the hostess and were quoted a  quoted 30-45 minute wait for a table. We knew the place was popular so weren't upset with the wait as we were looking forward to a wonderful dinner.  Went to the bar to order wine and that's when our disappointment started. We were sitting in plain view at the edge of the bar facing the entry and there were TWO bartenders  In spite of this in the 15 minutes we waited occasionally waving and saying \"excuse me\" to get the bartenders' attention we never even got so much as a Hi and certainly not an opportunity to order a drink.  I had only just told my wife I wasn't willing to wait another 15-30 minutes wine free when the hostess pleasantly surprised us by saying a table was ready. Our relief was short lived however.  After being seated it was approximately 5 minutes before our server came to the table. We ordered wine and water.  Our wine and water came NINE minutes later... a total of over 30 minutes since we entered the restaurant before we received our first beverage.  We skipped an appetizer planning ahead for dessert and for our entree ordered Rainbow Trout with a side of Truffle Parmesan Fries.  Approximately 15 minutes later our SIDE of Truffle Parmesan Fries showed up... sans trout.   When asked about the missing trout she said it'd be a few more minutes because the kitchen was backed up. When asked why she brought the side of fries she said she thought we wanted them first a leap of logic that totally escaped us.   When our server said she could take the fries back \"to keep them warm until our trout was ready\" my wife and I looked at each other in amazement and made a spontaneous decision that given we were now STARVING our original side of fries would serve us better as a hot appetizer than as a reheated side with dinner.  Finally a few minutes after our Truffle Parmesan Fries were gone our trout arrived. As I indicated in the begining it saved the day. The fish was fresh perfectly prepared and exceptional.  As good as the trout was however is wasn't good enough to make us ever return to the Greene House. There is no reason any customer should suffer through such slow and uninspired service when there are at least a dozen restaurants within a 2 mile radius of this one (much less dozens more throughout the Phoeniz metro area) that are SIGNIFICANTLY more enjoyable.   Spend your hard earned money somewhere else
pos	I used to shop her constantly when I live right across the street and I still make the drive up there even though the prices are higher than Safeway. Why?  -The staff rocks. Need a certain type of wine? They know where to find it. Need a spice? That's covered too. Every employee is courteous and most importantly SPEAKS FLUENT ENGLISH.  -Their deli rocks my socks. Always fresh and always tasty I've purchased more than a few dinners and have never been disappointed.  -The ready to cook stuff is delicious too. In the mood for some kind of meat stuffed with a vegetable and/or cheese? This is the place.  -I also loved the fresh food cooked every day right in the store. From BBQ to MASSIVE Sunday omelets the choices are a plenty. Again not cheap but you certainly get your money's worth. Go early if you want the breakfast they run out quick.  And you can buy good beer by the bottle! Dogfish Head rocks.
neg	Long wait for food waitresses that don't know what they're doing grumpy hosts and crappy food that keeps us off the lake for 2 hours is not somewhere I plan on going ever again.
pos	Since moving to Arizona I have selected Fry's as my new grocer and am very happy with my choice! I immediately signed up for their VIP card and love seeing the many savings listed on the receipt after every trip.  I am especially happy that I have moved closer to this Frys as it is open 24 hours and even when shopping in the wee hours of the morning can expect to see some nocturnal ASU students.  Any interactions I have had with the staff have been pleasant and enjoyable.
neg	I have received two pedicures and a manicure from this location.  I usually prefer a more spa like experience but the cost is low and I was attempting to save a few dollars.  Cutting cost may not be a good thing to do when it comes to body care.  I won't be returning because I am concerned about health violations.  Pros: Quick service Cheaper than the spa salon  Cons: Improper cleaning of foot baths.  I thought they were good until I saw them seat a women at a used station.  They only took the sprayer and rinsed the dirty bowl.  (I did let her know)  The foot massage was more like a foot beating.  About an hour later my ankles felt like I had rolled them.  It took almost two weeks for them to feel normal again.  The sent in the shop is of fake nails.  If everyone has on a mask I would like one to.
pos	Great decor. Great food and very good service. You have to try the pork belly pastrami. To die for! Their version of the Manhattan was very good. As for the main courses you can't go wrong with the scallops or the smoked duck. For dessert go with the black & tan pudding. Oh soooo good. Highly recommend this place.
neg	Ugh. I don't like giving a tough review but this is a store that needs to address a couple things.  1. The Service: Long lines and unpleasant cashiers.  2. Outdated Store: This wouldn't be so obvious if they just did a little cleanup and merchandising. 3. Produce: Maybe in this store they should just no offer produce. The little corner in the store makes you think it was an afterthought.   I think just a couple things that wouldn't cost much money would go a long way in making this store a go to place for me. Not there right now.
pos	Ditto what Kristi M. said.  Thank you to my fellow Yelpers for helping me find this place.
neg	Ugh!!    A 25 min wait greeted us before anyone recognized our presence.  We were offered complientary champaigne in consideration.  Who drinks champainge??  We were allowed to order wine prior to hearing of the chef's feast which offers a wine pairing.  That's dumb.  We ordered a meat/cheese plate.  It contained head cheese.  Hmmmm.  Overpriced and oversalted.  30 min later our salads came.  The salads were ok and unfortunately the highlight of the meal.  35 min later our main course came.  Overcooked uneventful lame.  I can't drink alcohol and ordered water.  Twice I was left w/ no water for extended periods.  Both times I was foced to ask for water.  There were no hand towels in the unisex bathroom.  It's no fun to dry your hands using toilet paper.  The \"best\" part was saved for last.  Quiessence automatically adds an 18\% gratuity which is OK assuming the service is at least adequate.  It wasn't.  Further as our waiter dropped the bill he explained the 18\% \"goes to the house\" and anything additional we might addd though not required is most appreciated.  Egad....why does the house need a service charge w/ the magnificent margins they charge for their normal food service?  And why do they put their staff in the position of shaking down their patrons for tips?  Although it's a very nice calming setting I found myself wanting to leave after the first appy.  Food service and ancillary were simply terrible.  Stay away.  You'll spend your $175 for 2 much better most anywhere else.
pos	Four Peaks serves up some great beers and great eats.  This is no secret so no matter which day out of the year or which hour and minute out of the day you go you will see a full patio and a populated bar.  Plan accordingly.  Try their Italian beer bread the Carne Adovada or the Southwest burger and wash it down with a pint of Hop Knot or Kilt Lifter.  You will be happy you did.  All of Four Peaks' menu items are appropriately priced and you will always leave satisfied.
neg	And then it all changed...  I think this is my very first review that has been demoted to 1 star after being on the coveted 5 star for a long time.   So where do I start. After feeling dog sick for a few days I finally decided to \"walk-in\" to this place because that's what they do now supposedly. They take walk in patients who are seen by the NP. I signed in at 8:20 and was not called in the back until 10:00am. Then I waited another 35 minutes for the NP to come in and see me. By the time everything was over it was 11:00am before I walked out of this place.   I asked to talk to Brenda the office manager and was brushed off twice. Supposedly she is going to call me but would not see me when i was there for two and a half hours! I guess she didn't have the balls to face me at that point. What could she have said really?   The front desk lady did a screw up and let another walk in patient go before me even though he came 10 minutes after I had already signed in. When I pointed that out she said he came before me and I had to show her the sign in chart. Instead of apologizing she just kept doing what she was busy doing without acknowledging her mistake.   When the NP did come see me she missed a couple of key things in my chart that she totally should have asked me about. I was quite appalled. I had to point out a deathly allergy that I have even though it should already be in my chart.   My final analysis: In my opinion don't go here if your health and time are valuable to you.
pos	Wow this place is fabulous.  Everything is so fresh and tasty that you can enjoy a healthy and yummy meal without breaking the bank.  The salad bar is huge and they have a fresh soup bar where you can choose numerous varieties of homemade soups.  Great tasting desserts and frozen yogurt machine.  Best Strawberry Lemonade I have ever tasted.  You have to try this place you will not be disappointed.  They need to open locations in the Midwest.  Also I want to give a shout out to the server at the restaurant.  His name is Oscar and he is so wonderful and funny.  He made us all laugh and smile and Oscar is such a hard worker and everyone that visits this location has to say hello to Oscar because he is the nicest man ever!
neg	Found the doctor via his website and called for an appointment. The ladies that answer the phone are sweet so I felt I made a good choice. I was taken into the room and a sweet girl asked me questions and told me the doctor would be right in. He came in quickly and asked if I would mind if someone that was following him would be present. Fine. The other guy walked in along with a lady (medical assistant maybe). No one introduced either of them. Dr. Racette didn't ask me one question and didn't address any of my concerns. He seemed to even brush off the questions I asked or responded with brusqueness. It was very irritating as a patient to be asking questions about serious topics like skin cancer and feel blown off. He prescribed a cream for me and was walking out the door minutes after seeing me and said he would have someone come in with the script. He never talked to me about how the cream works or what it does. Awful awful. Too top it off they were supposed to call me with test results. I had to call them and the gal that answered said \"no one called you with the results yet?: NO!! Will not see this doctor again. Sorry but I actually prefer doctors that care to take the time and actually address my questions and make me feel comfortable not take 5 minutes to rush me through an appointment.
pos	Always love the ALofts If you've stayed at one they're pretty much the same Rooms were clean and comfortable. There was plenty of room in the standard king room Bathroom was nice you don't have to deal with the miniature shampoos they're in the wall mounted containers which is nice. Only thing missing is an iron and ironing board but other than that the room was perfect especially if you like hip modern decor which I do.  Rooms are a notch above TheStandard in LA but not quite as roomy.  The rest of the property was just OK yes they have a lounge but need a restaurant.  This location also does not have a DJ as some of the other ALofts do. All in all though probably one of the best hotels to stay in while in the Phoenix area especially for the price.  I heard from the bartender that the one in Tempe is more live than this one.
neg	I'm sorry. You're too busy to look up my club card information? Too busy too push the button to do the search enter my phone number and click ok?  I took the time once upon whenever to sign up for your card. And now you can't take 5 seconds to look it up for me? Let me clue you in the cashiers here have always looked it up. It always takes 5-10 seconds at most! Great customer service. Insert sarcasm here for the uneducated.  Other Big Lots this hasn't been a problem. Just the one.
pos	I have always loved this place.   Good Food fair price  and typically a couple of cute girls working there.  All around good place..   its a go to .
neg	After landing in PHX but before embarking on a 2.5 hour drive to Flagstaff i thought Wendy's would be a safe and easy place to grab some food on the go...well I was wrong.  * Chicken Nuggets: dry freezer-burned meat with extra hard double-fried shell.  * French Fries: super hot crunchy over-fried french-fry-shaped fry-shells. so hard and crunchy that i thought i was eating french-fry chips.  * Junior Bacon Cheese Burger: bacon and burger meat both tasted dehydrated.  Guess what last thing I want after a 4hr flight and landing in 100+ weather is hot dry crunchy tasteless food!
pos	Sanctuary you've been replaced.  Willow Stream Spa is my new fav spa spot.  Loved. Loved. the service. Robe got slightly damp from use helpful attendant appears and gives me a new one.  Loved the waterfall treatment.  Loved private rooftop pool.  Loved the attendant walking around giving us sun bathers bottles of cold water.  Loved the fitness classes the facility. All this for $50 during AZ Spa Week.   The facility and service is so f-a-b-u-l-o-u-s here that I would come here anytime and think every penny I spent was worth it!
neg	Walked in during late lunch hour. Did not get acknowledged for about 5 mins. When I finally got sat down and served my salad I found a hair in it. Got no apology. Just a sigh firm the waitress when she took it away. You can't pay me to go back here. The waiters are rude.
pos	I can't believe this wasn't reviewed yet!  This place rocks and Dr. Heather is the very best vet in town. She's reasonable in price thorough in her evaluations and super kind. She handled the life and death issues so carefully and warmly and she talks about her own pets and has compassion!   When our cat Everett died she not only called us throughout the whole cremation process but she sent a card and when we picked up the ashes - she had made a single footprint \"ornament\" with a ribbon and his name on it as a gift.  Never had a vet do anything so kind.    We have had MANY cats and MANY VETS.  I know a good vet. Go here. Please go here!
neg	Absolutely waste of time & space is this establishment. Don't bother checking in with the host to be seated as I saw many people just seat themselves although there was a 20 min wait for others the staff rude uncaring & could possibly be where all the servers go that can't get a job in any other Resteraunt. A complete disgrace & I would never give such a place my hard earned money I suggest you do the same.
pos	probably my favorite restaurant :)
neg	IF YOU HAVE KIDS YOU MUST READ!!! My husband and I have never been more insulted at a restaurant than tonight at the Hillstone Restaurant (Biltmore). This is the same restaurant group that includes Bandera and Houston's.   We deliberately went out early-- at 5pm -- with another couple and our son. He started to fuss on and off during dinner. Mind you the restaurant was already noisy when the GM Miranda Geranios instructed us to leave; other patrons were complaining. That was news to us- and we've seen far worse outbursts in the past from children. Ironically our son at that moment was playing happily with the other couple when she rudely asserted herself.   We were in the middle of dinner and to add insult to injury she didn't even offer to compensate us for a future visit without our little guy. Just go home without dinner and pay the bill. Of course she herself has no children.  To ask a repeat customer to leave is absolutely disgusting. We will never visit any of their establishments again and wanted to share our unfortunate experience with our friends who also know the challenges of having a family.
pos	This is a great hole in the wall shop off of Val Vista Rd. I've been getting the chicken salad sandwich since 2006 and it's the same ever since GREAT! Cookies and bread are awesome as well...
neg	07/09/2008   Just went there last week for the first and last time.  I read the good reviews so I was expecting much more.  I am a first generation American; both my parents were German and came over in their 20's.  I lived there for a few years have eaten German food all my life and have been to many German restaurants in many different states over the years.  I really wanted to like this place as there are not many German establishments around here but this place was terrible!  We were the only people in the place at 2pm and still had horrible service.  ???  We were ignored much of the time and then when the waitress did come she would forget things we had asked her for.  The waitress didn't understand German as in the German MENU options so I ordered from the menu using the English translations and she was still confused. I had to POINT at the options.  YES there really is CUCUMBER salad on the menu.  The bread was stale the schnitzel was hard there was a hair in my cucumber salad and my potato pancakes were just ...disgusting.  They also gave me fries instead of the usual sides????  I am guessing that they just reheated leftovers from the dinner the night before because that is exactly what it tasted like.  Plus I actually got charged the wrong prices - like lunch salad was 3.50 but showed up on my bill as 5.00 etc.  I was too frustrated to even bring it up and just left disappointed.  Waste of time and money I will not return.  Maybe at dinner time things are better but DO NOT EVEN TRY THE LUNCH!  Yuck. Oh and the website is outdated- wrong prices and discontinued menu items.
pos	This place had me from the moment our waitress asked us if it was o.k. if our water was infused with the flavor of cucumber.  Heck yeah it was o.k. in fact I don't even want to order a drink I just want the free cucumber water!  My buddy and I decided to start with an app. order of sweet potato waffle fries with dipping sauce.  Delightful!  I ordered the sweet potato and garbonzo burger and the sweet potato and avocado salad side dish.  Notice the sweet potato theme??  I love those crazy orange taters!  The food was really tasty and quite flavorful.  The burger was a little different than I expected because it didn't come on a bun..but no biggie.  In typical girl fashion my buddy and I split a cupcake...finger lickin' good!  I am picky-picky but this place won me over big time!  Also I felt that for the location their prices were very reasonable.  The prices for those condos located upstairs..well that's gotta be a different story!
neg	I keep wanting to like this place.  I want to support a local business and yet....  Last year I took my two boys there after a theater performance (Greasepaint!   Excellent!) and after we placed our orders for lunch I took out our SET game (it's a card game that does not use a traditional deck - great fun).  WIthin moments the server was back at our table.  \"You can't do that.\"  \"What?  Play cards?  It's not gambling.\" (Maybe I was wrong but living here you start to assume that an objection to something must be religion based).  \"The owners don't allow it.\"  \"They don't allow it?  It's a matching game.\"  \"No.  You'll have to put it away.\"  Now.  I would understand not wanting us to sit and play cards if we'd finished eating and were just holding a table (assuming it was busy).   However this was during the gap between ordering and eating.  I KNOW I should've just left then.  Instead I made my kids happy and we stayed for lunch (and ice cream!).    A couple months ago I (foolishly) decided to try again.  Didn't bother with the cards this time.  The lousy thing this time was the mold on my son's bread.  They DID remove the sandwich from the bill but eish.      I'd kind of like the \"Restaurant Impossible\" guy to come in here and give it an overhaul.  I don't mind the nostalgia stuff but the place does need a solid going over.
pos	If you don't love Guissepe's you don't love Italian. Kindly find your way to a chain restaurant that serves bland unseasoned frozen-then/microwaved meats sauces that are fit for an old folks home and an \"endless\" pasta and salad bar. Go to these places because Guissepe's is not for you.  It's for lovers of true Northern/Northeast American Italian cuisine. Chicken Parm that is fried NOT baked thank you very much. Meatballs that use beef veal and pork. Sauce that use LOTS of salt as it should be. Leave your dietary worries at home.   In a word: perfecto.  Robert's passion for music (he's a well known accomplished cellist in NY circles) and food is unparalleled. He is without peer in the state of Arizona.   But be warned... there ain't no endless pasta bowl here.   Their weekday lunches are equally superior. This is Italian the way we had it growing up in North Jersey.
neg	This place needs to close their doors get their act together and then reopen. The atmosphere is boring and it is obvious that they did the bare minimum coverup from the last restaurant. The food is horribly boring and has no flavor. I ordered the chicken and avocado pizza and it literally tasted like nothing! We also got the nachos (which was actually just a plate of chips with one tiny pinch of cheese and soggy beef). In addition the server didn't put in my order for my pizza hardly apologized and then brought it to me 30 minutes after my friends were done eating. One of my friends ordered the ahi tuna and it was switched with someone else's special order so that had to go back to the kitchen and be reordered as well. The only thing I liked was the beer and that too took forever and I had to remind my server several times to get me a refill. Way to much effort to get food and drink that is sub par at best.
pos	BEAUTIFUL! Phoenix doesn't get much more amazing then when you're looking down at her from Dobbins Lookout.  A few tips: 1. Get there before 6pm. The park closes the entry but if you're in you can stay as long as you want.  2. Be ready for a drive up a mountain -- scary cliffs and tight corners. Make sure you go slow watch for hikers and cyclists and overall be cautious. 3. If you're heading to the summit for the views (Dobbins Lookout) bring a jacket or blanket. It's cold and windy when the sun goes down even in the summer.  There are bathrooms but no water fountains at the Lookout.
neg	Thank you to Sarah L for bringing to my attention that the lunch menu from which I got my information about the $34 crab cake entree was for the NYC location. However I did note that the crab cake appetizer at the Scottsdale location  - presumably a smaller portion than the lunch entree - is $16. Yes yes. It is Barney's and I understand the premium pricing. What I question is how Fred's scored only $$. I often eat out with those on a tighter foodie budget than mine; the $$ is misleading when Oregano's is also $$. Just sayin'.
pos	Took Travis here for one of our first dates and just LOVE Cibo.  It's situated in a home from 1913 and has colored lights wrapped all around the trees.  You can either sit inside or on the gorgeous patio.  Brick oven pizza and cheese plates offered here and it's definitely a place for a cool date.
neg	This place sucks!! I moved to the valley and have yet to find that \"go to \" chinese spot sooo I decided to give this spot a try. I called my order in and was assured by the employee that all the food is cooked to order always fresh. So I picked up my food and what do you know I got some old azz fried rice with some microwaved shrimp. WTF??!! I give this place 2 thumbs down and I would not eat here if I was hungry as a hostage :(
pos	I don't think my husband will let me rate it anything less than 5 stars...   Parking for us was okay since we did not park in the lot we parked at neighboring house for 5 bucks.  Grabbed some towels from the hotel and staked out our claim on the lawn... People were very friendly.  My hubby met some folks from Dixon IL the day before and they came by to say Hi... and of course watching the Cubbies - can't beat that!!!
neg	I really hate to do this.  This restaurant is fit for those that think Taco Bell is a great place for Mexican food.  The buffet was pathetic and contained maybe 12 items (no white rice).  My sampling of their offerings ranged from terrible to mediocre.  China Garden has hands down the worst eggroll I've eaten.  Given the atmosphere of the place it was plain to see China Garden had regulars.  One guy at the cashier even commented that he'd been coming since 1970.  I don't get it.  This is the worst restaurant I have ever dined at.  The staff and whom I presumed to be the owner/manager was nice and friendly but that cannot make up for the poor quality of selection and food.
pos	We were shopping at the Bass Pro Shop in Tempe and decided to go for ice cream to kill some time before dropping my parents off at the airport. I pulled out my iPad and 'yelped' ice cream. It brought up 4 options in the area and we chose Dairy Queen which was a few blocks away.  As luck would have it there was no left turn onto Dobson and we ended up going East on the 202 the opposite direction of the Dairy Queen.  So I searched again and we came up with Yogurtland.  It wasn't luck after all but some ice cream higher power at work to bring us to our frozen yogurt oasis in Yogurtland.  Not only were the ingredients fresh and delicious but the price was reasonable as well. 5 of us each had a scrumptious & generously portioned sundae and our total bill was less than $20!  We all enjoyed our selections.  One topping surprise was the Fruit Pebbles cereal my daughter put on her sundae.  The fruity crunch they added was delish!    Yogurtland was a home run!  Thanks For the Yelp!
neg	We went here for a family dinner.  Our family is loud and boisterous but not obnoxious.  We asked to be seated in the bar since some of us wanted to watch the game.  No problems so far.  Our waiter was really nice at first but seemed flustered and as if he wasn't getting the help he needed to keep up with his tables.  I waited tables for 12 years and this guy was nearly literally scrambling to keep up a sure sign of not enough help or lack of teamwork.  Of the two hostesses ONE of them could have bothered to help him out by refilling water tea and soda for us but alas they did nothing.  We waited so long for drink refills that my husband got up and saw a pitcher of coke on the bar so he poured himself a glass which he was scolded for!  I could not believe it I was shocked.  A guest should NEVER be treated this way.  If anything someone should have apologized to my husband for not giving us what we needed for the meal.   The chips were good and they kept them coming so props to them for that.  They are served with bean dip and salsa.  I liked the salsa a lot not spicy enough for me but a good amount and mixture of yummy stuff including cilantro which I find many \"salsas\" don't even contain!  To me it is not salsa without cilantro.  The teensy bowls of salsa they bring though need some rethinking.  They should either bring one per person or consider a bigger size.  It's only about 2 Tablespoons and that aint much salsa (beware some sides of rice and beans also come in these super tiny containers - three or four bites and it's gone)!  Anyhow we ate tons of chips and salsa because the food took SO long to come out.  Our waiter sort of apologized for this by keeping us updated that it was actually coming.....someday.  Our food came out a good 35-40 minutes after we ordered.  Sadly two meals were completely missing in action and the two of us that ordered fajitas (which came out of the kitchen very cool not even the slightest bit of heat from the iron skillet or the meat) had to wait at least 10 minutes for their tortillas so they couldn't even eat what was at the table which was getting cold.  After the two missing meals came out one was the wrong meat red meat instead of chicken.  More waiting...the table eats minus one.  When everyone is nearly finished the right chicken taco dish comes out.  It was delicious but overpriced.  The chicken was nicely grilled and the tacos were served the way I like them with a little bit of onions more cilantro lettuce lime and pico de gallo.  They also came with cheese but I don't like cheese on tacos.  They came on tiny little corn tortillas which themselves were good but way too small to make decent tacos that didn't fall apart.  Plus I ran out of  the tortillas before my meat and other stuff was gone.  Our waiter was really nice except for the scolding (I'm still floored by that) so I can't decide if he sucked or the place sucks or maybe they both do...We definately won't be back.
pos	Great product! I was on a mission to make homemade mozzarella with the absolute best ingredients I could find. Organic whole raw milk -  this certainly did the trick! We'll be going back that's for sure!
neg	The food was okay but the portion sizes where the smallest I have ever seen....and I am a regular to fox restaurants.    Babbo is much better.
pos	I've been giving a lot of 5-star reviews lately but (in my opinion) they all deserve it.    Movies on Central RULES.  They have 99.9\% of every movie title we've looked for.  Since summer started we've been in there at least once a week.  Bonus:  they have a water cooler right by the door.  Sweet!
neg	I was so so hopeful.  October in Scottsdale yummy tacos.....Wow!  Rip Off!! $10 Just to get in (what was that for?). No shade unless you were buying a drink.  Most places wouldn't give you salsa or taco sauce with your measly over priced taco. They seemed like the vultures who didn't care about the customer just the $2 ticket they could grab from you.   I had to beg for a napkin then hunt for a place to sit feeling watched by the other vultures waiting for me to get up. I was ready to leave after 45 minutes and my Pepsi had gotten warm so I had gotten a cup of ice from the bar.   I poured it in took one drink and as I was leaving to hike back to my car security stopped me and would n't let me take it out! \"It could have booze in it\".  Well by then I was one angry little local. Dumped it all in trash and said to my sweet daughter in law who was about to \"go mad\" with me \"Get me outta here!\". She had brought her 2 year old thinking what a fun way to spend a Saturday morning and encourage our local businesses.  Nope.  Not good.
pos	I can't believe it took me this long to visit Sportsman's but now that I have I know I'll be making my way back soon enough! Sportman's is a combination wine bar and retail store for spirits wine champagne and beer galore. Plus it's locally owned by the Basha's family!   I like Sportsman's because it's a friendly and warm atmosphere and they have a great variety of discounts for their different levels of alcohol. The walls are lined from the floor to the ceiling with every type of alcohol. The prices range from $10 - thousands of dollars! It's pretty easy to find any type of brand here. Since it's the holiday season they are currently offering sales on several of their high-end brands which makes it easy to visit for the purchase of a gift! I also like the fact that guests can visit the intimate bar area and sip on some beverages to take a break from shopping. They also make customized gift baskets!
neg	What happened to this place?  The first time I went about a year ago both the food and service were great.  Second time last May I ordered the same dish and it was horrible.  Drowning in sauce.  But at least the service was decent.  Just went a third time and it will be my last.  Both the food and service were horrible.  Went for lunch sat inside and it wasn't very busy.  Our waiter was totally out of it and only had 4 tables and hardly paid any attention to us and kept forgetting things like taking our order to start.    Then even the food runner forgot to bring me half my meal after I asked her for it.  In the meantime I counted at least 17 staff member hanging out in the kitchen area which is open so you can see them and half of them were folding napkins.  My food was not very good and actually made me a little sick.  This is a shame especially because there aren't many places in Phx that have vegan choices but for the price you pay I would expect a lot more.
pos	Great views great food great service and great atmosphere!  We thoroughly enjoyed our dinner here and couldn't believe the neighborhood special - 3 courses for $35!  The split pea soup was amazing as well as the bing cherry cheesecake...yum!
neg	Honestly I don't get it.  I went to Dos Gringos with a good friend of mine last weekend.  I had never been to Phoenix before so I was excited to see what the city had to offer.  After entering Dos Gringos we sat at our table for 21 minutes before a waitress came to our table.  She brought us 2 beers and never came back. After 40 minutes we decided to check out a new bar since we obviously weren't welcomed at Dos Gringos.  So we went up to the bar where I waited for 5 minutes so the bartender could take some pictures and shots with her friends.  What I didn't understand was there were maybe only 20 people there and at least 6 people working.  If I was the owner or manager I would be embarrassed to say that you run that establishment.  I will never return and I highly recommend you stay away from Dos Gringos as you will be disappointed.
pos	I bought the HomeRun offer for a bike tune up at Trailhead.  I have to say that I was surprised at the quality of the service they did to my Trek hybrid bike. I could definitely tell the bike was riding better smoother more efficient. They even re-installed my bike computer threading the wire around the front right fork very neatly.  I definitely recommend this place. Oh and the food is good too!
neg	Ok..I told Amanda that anyplace that serves beer would have a tough time getting less than 2 stars from me...I wish there were 1.5 however.   As covered by Amanda this bar is about as straight as they come..this bar personified would probably call bars with any hippness at all the bad F word for gay folk. In fact this bar would most certainly over-use that word.   Does Puddle of Mudd Disturbed and POD know that their songs are available in karaoke form? Do they make money from them? Who was the first person to say damn man I can not wait to scream this song to the MIDI music only version over some beers this weekend.  I had a good time...but I tend to make the best of things. There was far more facial hair than head hair. I hate phonetic spellings.. Oh lord don't ever make me go back.  ...eff it...I changed my mind. 1.2 stars and I am rounding down.
pos	Great food and even better beer. Staff are always friendly.  My favorite microbrewery in the Valley.
neg	Lets just say i was not to please with my experience at Nails R Us. After two days my nails were lifting on about 4 nails by the end of the weekend i had 6 nails lifting so i went back and showed them and she was like its normal. No it normal to lift but not after 2 days! They did fix them for me free of charge but were very rude to me!!! Will not be going back there or will not refer any of my friends there!
pos	After writing the review the other day I had a taste for Pappa's. So I went last night and YA-HUMMEE! I tried something new the Hudson platter and this baby did not disappoint! Perfectly grilled scallops 2 succulent and sweet lobster tails 4 huge shrimp brochette. If you are not familiar with shrimp brochette it is shrimp stuffed with Monterey jack cheese and a sliver of Jalapeno wrapped in bacon and char -grilled. DELICIOUSNESS! It is served with the fabulous dirty rice and sauteed green beans all for are you ready for this wait for it 22.95!   I also indulged in sharing a little pecan sweet potato pie with Hagen daas vanilla ice cream and bourbon sauce. WOOHOO! FYI all deserts purchased until July 26th will have a portion of the proceeds go to a local food bank!   Dinner last night was sooo freakin good I may be back tonight! Bon Appetite
neg	The service here was awful we waited patiently for over 15 minutes for our server to come by our table. Finally a hostess came by and noticed nobody was helping us and got us drinks. Another 15 minutes roll by and finally our server decides to make an appearance saying \"have you guys decided yet on what you want?\" uhh yeah! Overall service was poor and food was just okay. Won't be going back.
pos	I'm glad I bought my tickets back in August when the event was first posted.  I'm not sure the organizers knew what an amazing turn out they would have but the event was sold out so tickets were not available at the door.  We arrived at 11:15 (doors opened at 11) and while standing in line to get in there was a staff person checking to make sure we all had tickets and letting people know that if they did not the event was sold out.   Once inside it was a sea of cupcakes!  Tiny cupcakes that were delicious!  I didn't taste one that I didn't like.  Liberty Market was my fave I think.  Espresso Carmel and Red Velvet!  YUM!!!  Cruelty Free Cakes makes delicious vegan cupcakes too!  I also liked the ones from Cry Baby Ranch. I'm going to have to find them again at the 20th street Farmers Market and Old Town Scottsdale Farmers Market.  And everyone was so nice!    $10 got you all the cupcakes you could eat and water AND milk!!  And it was for two very worthy causes.  Singleton Moms and Safe Haven For Animals.  There were also raffles a cupcake eating contest and cupcake decorating for the kids.  So many festivals these days charge you to get in and then once inside charge for everything else.  People can't afford that these days so it was refreshing to go to an event and not be nickel and dimed for everything.  I appreciate that.  And best of all my daughter had a great time!  There were lots of people so it was a little overwhelming for her but she loved it.  Both of us are just coming down from our sugar high.    It was great to see Gabi and Lindsey manning the Yelp booth and our very own Thomas S. helping with emcee duties!    Will I be back next year?  You bet!!  And you should come too....just make sure you get your tickets early!
neg	Closed on Sunday?  Looks like you've not only lost my Sunday dollars but my business on Monday through Saturday too.
pos	Our administrative assistant at work is a big fan of Bertha's.  And now I am too.  She's ordered in lunch from Bertha's a couple of times.  The first time it was the Thai chicken salad which I loved.  Today we had two salads and a sandwich tray.  I don't even like sandwiches.  I helped myself to both salads and picked up a sandwich intending to dismantle it and eat the meat and cheese.  Inexplicably I took a bite of the sandwich and said \"OMG!  This is so good!\"  It was the turkey w/bacon and avocado sandwich.  My friend seated directly to my left said \"Let's go to Bertha's and order more of these after lunch.\"  They were truly that good.  The salads were both great too.  I think we'll be frequenting Bertha's a lot in the immediate future.
neg	2nd time messing up our carry out order. Boneless wings have bones and no carrots or celery again!!  Hamburger with only tomato cheese and BBQ sauce had onions and lettuce when we specifically said no lettuce or onion. Allergic to onions and don't like shredded lettuce. Thanks to Tiler for messing up our order again. Will not be back.
pos	I don't know what I would do if this store ever closed.  It's right near our home has an excellent selection of both wine meats and produce.  Note that wine is mentioned first... I can't help it!  The service is always really good too.  Everyone who works here seems like they really love their job.  The only issue I have ever had was not being able to get basil a couple of times.  I got over it.  :D
neg	I called The Town Dump to ask if I could come in this week and interview them for an English paper about a small local business and the owner was just incredibly rude. She didn't even let me finish telling her it would take five minutes of her time preferring to interject and tell me to go somewhere else. When I explained that I've heard wonderful things about their business from friends and that that sparked my interest she said \"Well go somewhere else.\" I've never even been inside and I sure as hell won't go now. Maybe it's just me but I don't like shopkeepers who snarl at their customers.
pos	I always look forward to a haircut with my fave Barber David. $13 always gets me the cut I want. I used to head down to a another Barber off of Central Ave but never got the haircut I wanted. Now I never have to worry about that. So if you're ever in need of a Barber shop cut give David or one of his gals a try. Cheers!
neg	Ok im not getting the great reviews on this place. I FINALLY made it Lamar's before they closed for the day and tried a couple donuts. I have a few problems here. The big one can we please list that \"only the donuts with holes\" are $5.49 for 6? Its a bit deceptive to just list the price of 6 and ring up the donuts and have them turn out to be well over $7. Makes me want to buy my donuts from someone else.     Second these donuts are WAY over priced and they are average at best. The maple bar tastes like you are eating spoon fulls of sugar they are so sweet. And the rest of the donuts I tried were pretty stale. This will be the first and last time I will be going to Lamar's. Give me Krispy Kreme or anyone else for that matter. Thank god for Lamar's we dont have Spudnuts in the valley because they would be out of business.
pos	My van broke down and I needed a tow real fast because I had my kids with me in the heat. I looked up towing on my phone and just happened to pick Leyva's. I am so glad I did. I spoke with Chris and he was very nice and helpful. The driver was there within 20 minutes and was also so so nice to me and my kids. He was very clean and professional and courteous.  The whole experience was better than I have every had with a towing company. I keep their card in my wallet now and gladly refer them.
neg	I have nothing more to add but I don't want anyone to think 'only a few' people had  complaints about this poorly planned \"festival.\"   Oh wait I do.   I was there with my 4 year old grand-daughter (and my daughter) since there were going to be kids attractions as well as the food trucks. I thought it was nuts that 3 minutes of jumping around cost $3. But I guess it was consistent with the $4 water and $7 beers.  And it would help if there was some roadway controls and/or temporary signage. By 11am traffic backed up (down) Pima from the event to Indian Bend and over towards the 101. Cars were skipping ahead and cutting into line further delaying entrance.   If success is measured by interest the festival was a success. If by performance and customer satisfaction not so much. And how can a vendor commit to showing and not have enough food to feed the presold ticket holders? Why risk your hard-fought reputation?
pos	Delicious food amazing martini's and wonderful desserts. Every dish I have eaten here has been nothing short of awesome. First to start they have house infused seasonal vodkas. You can see the vodkas steeping on the bar when you walk in. Appetizers are not overly filling - The frito misto is always seasonal so depending on the time of year you will get different things. The coating is perfect and light so you can really taste the vegetables but still get the crunch. The same is true with the mozzarella. The cheese was fresh and the crunchy crust of fried coating around it was perfect.   As far as entrees go the portions are perfectly sized and flavorful. The pasta is perfectly cooked and coated with whatever you choose on the menu. I love the simplicity of some and the complexity of others. Finally desert has always been good. Try the limoncello cheesecake or any flavor of gelato and you certainly won't be disappointed.
neg	It's been a few months since I've been here and what a change not for the better. I usually get the same thing to start with ceviche and pollo asado. Both are usually quite delicious not this time.  The ceviche had absolutely no flavor to it. As if the chef tried to make it as flavorless as possible. I did not finish it as it was not enjoyable in the least. Now for the tacos. Stale taco shells dried and overcooked chicken slopped on guac and no pico de gallo. The tacos were so bad I tried to rescue them by asking for pico de gallo since they did not put any on and then I was charged $1.00 extra. Of course no manager was anywhere in sight. This place simply doesn't care. On the bright side the margaritas and salsa are still good but the chips were stale.  Not only will I not return but I can no longer recommend this place to businessmen from out of town. I see dozens of new business people every day who stay in Scottsdale and they always ask for Mexican food and I've always said Cien Agaves. No more.
pos	Perfect burritos polite staff with a couple cuties working here.  I love Chipotle!
neg	They added broasted chicken to their menu... I love me some broasted chicken so in I went to investigate.  I do not love me THEIR broasted chicken.  To me it tasted rubbery and had a strange odor and it was so salty that an hour later I could still taste it. I ordered a few pieces and I ate part of one and then bolted.  I can't speak to anything else on the menu. Their garlic knots for what it's worth were fine.
pos	A few years ago my husband bought me a gift certificate for this spa. Oh my god - it was the most beautiful spa I had ever went to! I had a facial and a massage. In addition to that - I got unlimited day usage of their spa stuff! They had a beautiful locker room that had a sauna and jacuzzi in it. An secluded area where you could lay outside - naked! They also had a huge pool out behind the spa where you could just layout and be lazy. Oh- also they had some sitting rooms with magazines fire places -oh my goodness. It was awesome! AND - the prices weren't that high compared to other spa's in the valley. Check it out if you can!
neg	this is a business located in the fry's grocery strip mall on mckellips and recker I wont say much but don't bother the waitless girl was about as pleasent as a hemroid the beer selection sucked. I belive the owner was there at least the guy looked like the owner. it's always amazing to me how the service can be so horrible w/owner in house.
pos	We live by and love this place! Happy hour is most def the biggest bang for your buck! Try the shrimp boil but only if you like your shrimp a little spicy!
neg	This location was a Groupon find... Won't be back. The girl behind the counter was nice but even though I had the groupon right in front of me she had to read it several times and I had to explain to her what I was supposed to be getting with it. The red light therapy is a nice idea... But the room the bed was in was lacking. They should hire an exterminator not leave sticky bug traps down with dead bugs all over the floor where people generally have bare feet... Yuck!!
pos	Gallo Blanco has the most delicious ceviche I've ever tasted in AZ. Portion size is plentiful and the chips are quality. I love the indie music selection it really adds to the vibe of Gallo Blanco. If I'm in the area I make it a point to visit.
neg	I ate here for the first time a few weeks ago on a Friday night/Saturday morning after seeing a show at the Tempe Improv.  I came in around midnight and the place was not that busy. The waitress was pretty nice (did everything expected for a waitress) and the guy who I thought was the manager was easy to talk to. However those are the only two good things I can say about the restaurant.  I ordered the BBQ wings and they were TERRIBLE. The flavor was very bland and half cold. The blue cheese I ordered was quite watery as well.  I also sat by the kitchen and noticed that a guy in the back was washing a stool in a sink near where the food was made. Needless to say I won't be eating at Hooters anytime soon.
pos	What a joy to discover Thai Lahna with my friend Keith Galbut who has been going here for over 10 years. I can see why. Family owned and operated - and everyone is very friendly and helpful. Of course all that matters is the food right - and it's marvelous. We tried several dishes and all were well spiced and wonderful. Highly recommended.
neg	Read al lthe hype so decided to give Cyclo a try.  What a disappointment!  Portions were small and overpriced owner thinks she's the next best thing to sliced bread.  She needs to go back to Vietnam to remember how real Vietnamese food is prepared.  Give this place a miss.
pos	My roommate came home the other night with a Chocolate Cream pie and oh. my goodness! It is AMAZING! The crust is this wonderful crunchy chocolately wonderfulness. I think she bought a Groupon and I don't know how much she paid but the pie was so good regardless of full price I'm sure it's worth it!
neg	So there's no negative stars too bad. Tried ordering take out before actually eating there to try it - good thing you couldn't pay me to eat here.  The only thing about the Colossal Cobb salad I ordered was the price. $10 and change for lettuce just enough to cover the bottom of the styrofoam with a sprinkle of toppings. Where'd they get their chef Chili's? What a disappointment. All the reviews say ' a lot of food' ...for who an infant?  I had also ordered a couple of carmelized cookies as well. Didn't know deep fried greasy discs of oatmeal harder than concrete were called 'cookies'. Good grief the bakery wasn't even good! Had to spit those things out before they took out a filling.   The only good thing about Chandler Chompie's is Jason's Deli right next door.
pos	The Phoenix metro area is definitely not known for authentic Asian cuisine. China Magic Noodle House however is the real deal. This place reminds me of the Taiwanese delis that I used to go to in LA as well as noodle houses that I've frequented in Taipei.  They have a great selection of cold noodle hot noodle and soup noodle dishes. And a variety of ways to have your noodles (I typically order the thick noodles or shaved noodles). There's always a veggie on the whiteboard to try and the fried tofu is very tender and tasty with the dipping sauce.  If you're looking for a reasonably priced ethnically authentic meal in Phoenix (especially the East Valley) China Magic Noodle House should be near the top if not first on your list. the only negative that I would have about this place is that there isn't enough choices where chicken is the main protein.
neg	I am totally baffled why this place gets such good reviews. I have been there a few times because it's close to my work and I received some gift certificates for my birthday. Unfortunately after the last experience I can't go back.  Although they are very nice and have great prices I have to reveal the ugly truth:  1. They don't put any effort into sanitizing the tools or the pedicure bowl. I actually saw them clean the brushes and tools in the water I was soaking my feet in and then just rinse out the bowl after they were done... not spray soap nothing! 2. Reason #1 probably explains why my heals cracked so severely after my pedicure that they began to bleed.  I had to use peroxide neosprin and bandages for almost a week to get it heal.  3. They water down their nail polish... so much that it destroys the bond and polish never actually dries.  I hate to bash a business with good customer service but these practices are simply unacceptable.  I obviously won't be back. =(
pos	Was looking for a nice dinner place in Peoria to send my mom and step-dad for a birthday celebration.  The people at Flemings were wonderful.  They took my request over the phone and made sure they had a lovely evening.  Mom raved about the service and the photos she sent made the food look fantastic!
neg	My sister recently took her '98 VW New Beetle to First Class Auto in Scottsdale AZ for an overheating issue.  I'm normally the one who does the maintenance on the vehicle but I was ~600 miles away.  She described the symptoms as follows: overheating light came on while she was stuck in construction traffic and went back off once she was moving again.  I immediately suggested that the radiator fans may not be coming on for some reason.  Since I wasn't around to look at it she took it to First Class Auto.  She relayed the symptoms to the guys at First Class and also SPECIFICALLY requested they check  radiator fan functionality.  They told her the water pump was cracked and leaking needed a new thermostat and also replace the timing belt and serpentine belt while they were in there (water pump is driven by the timing belt on this engine--2.0L 8V 4 cyl AEG code).  Well a) I personally replaced the timing belt water pump and serpentine belt about 10000 miles ago as preventative maintenance.  What's more is the car hasn't lost any coolant since the job.  So the water pump being cracked is highly unlikely!  I did not replace the thermostat though.  Once she called me to tell me this I told her to decline the work and either take it somewhere else or wait for me to make a trip out.  I had a job to do that brought me almost half way to the Phoenix area so I decided I would make the trip the rest of the way to have a look for myself yesterday.  FIRST thing I did was check the radiator fans.  I turned on the AC and the fans didn't come on at all.  I pop the cover off the strip fuse panel that resides on top of the battery and found a melted 30 AMP fuse.  Guess what that fuse is for?  The RADIATOR FANS!  Imagine that.  Being a car that lived most of its life in Michigan some of the fuses and the fuse panel itself had become corroded and caused the one fuse and part of the fuse panel to melt.  The coolant level was exactly at the max level right where it was after I did the maintenance on it 10000 miles ago not to mention I checked it before her recent trip to Scottsdale (didn't have to add anything.  The car doesn't leak a drop of coolant).  Local dealer had a new fuse panel in stock I swapped it out and replaced all 3 of the 30 amp blade fuses as they were all corroded pretty badly.  The larger strip fuses were still decent.  The radiator fans now work as normal and the car does not overheat.  The hose coming off the thermostat also becomes pressurized and hot at the correct temperature as well so that's definitely not a problem!  Fans also come on automatically once the coolant temp hits 99 deg Celsius like they're supposed to.  Problem solved!  I drove down to First Class Auto today to give them a chance to explain/defend themselves but there was only one guy working in the shop who she didn't recognize and no one at the counter.  What great customer service!  So she COULD have spent the quoted $800 and STILL had the same problem!  She just got dinged for a ~$40 diagnostic fee... for an incorrect diagnosis.
pos	great food... HUGE wine list (same as Kashmere)...  whatever you do make sure to get there cob salad thing (stedson chopped salad)... I substituted the salmon for chicken but it is still out of this world... i know people that have brought in chefs from out-of-town to figure out what is in it so they can bring it home to their city... don't remember much else... but i remember i have never had anything bad since i have been going there.
neg	After moving back to the area from Cali I needed somewhere  to get my acrylics done. I usually like to get some kind of design or unique tips. After walking in I saw some tips I liked so I decided to try out this place. The first visit was bad the nail tech would not listen to the length of nails I was requesting and did a terrible job at shaping them. I always give people more than one chance so I went back and this time I got a pedicure first then the nail tech left the salon and I sat near the dryer for 45  min before approaching the manager about the length of time I had been waiting for a fill. He replied unapologetically that the tech had to leave to pick up her son from school... I sat another 15 min before I was seen by someone else. They also did a poor job. I will not spend my money somewhere that they do not value their customers. Not to mention they did a crap job and were overpriced when it came to designs and tips with prints on them. Don't waste your time here.
pos	Very delicious food without long waits! The staff is very friendly and accommodating. I look forward to going back.
neg	I'm sad to report that we dined here for lunch and it was inedible:(  Chef Aaron please come by and monitor your staff.  We had the eggplant sandwich and is was a disaster.  It was so overly oily and the bun and fries overwhelmed the plate.  The shrimp and grits were so average with the shrimp being of low quality.  The beer menu looked fabulous.  So I guess if this is just a watering hole things will be fine...but if you choose to dine be prepared to leave hungry and unsatisfied.  We hope this turns around.  The decor is cool and the staff is really fun and helpful...and we are hopeful for a great place to visit in the \"hood\".
pos	One word: PISTACHIO... in all its glory... no need to say more.
neg	UNBELIEVABLE!!  so enraged and appalled!!  i took my 91 yr old mom in to the salon for a mani-pedi.  after the pedicure she had the manicure and she asked for french tips.  the GIRL claims she asked mom if she wanted gel nails -- she's 91 did not understand the gal's \"english\" and can't hear so i presume she nodded.  after mom paid the charge of $60 and i picked her up (i had another appt.)  she told me about the charge and said she had never paid that much for a mani-pedi.  i called and was told the normal charge is $30 w/$5 added for french and HE said to come back cause it was mistake.  we did and the whole group of technicians said it was mom's fault for saying \"yes\" and would not concede AT ALL -- not in the slightest.  i found that to be awful and mom felt very taken advantage of.  i will NEVER return there and i caution any hearing-impaired customers to not use this business.  TO ME and of course to mom it was such a slam on the elderly. mom is a visitor from the east coast and at her age does not need to be treated that way.  VERY BAD BUSINESS!!!
pos	When I first stepped into Smeeks my entire face lit up I was figuratively (and quite literally) \"a kid in a candy store.\"   It's is a true one of a kind store it's so entertaining to just walk around in. The decor is fun the inventory is even more fun and the photo booth is by far the most fun!  The walls are full of great novelty items such as the Smoking Baby (that actually smokes!) Yodeling Pickle (that actually yodels!) and Fake Cigarettes that are surprisingly realistic! Plus Smeeks has a lot of really cool and delicious candy. My personal favorite was the Fat Pig organic chocolate bar (with Puntini coming in a close second).   Smeeks is most definitely my new favorite store in CenPho!
neg	As you walk in you are greeted by a sign that says Cash Only ATM inside alright times are tough I get it.  Then you see the special board which read \"Good Food Takes Time\" and there is a clock next to that.  Fine that's cool but the problem is that after waiting for our \"good food\" it came out and was awful.  My wife said she has tasted better pancakes out of the freezer section at the grocery store.  $30 later we boxed up the food only to throw it away.  The good news is that we went around the corner to the Breakfast Club and had an excellent meal.
pos	This review corresponds to my first Check-In to Oregano's.   Outside of the wait times I've not had a bad experience @ Oreganos. The food was good the people were friendly and I had a good time. This visit was no exception. Even when my wife got meat in her minestrone soup the situation was handled impressively well. I've known for years that my wife is a VERY picky eater when dining out she left all smiles and so did I.  It's one of few places I go to with \"stuff\" on the walls that I don't find obnoxious.    Keep up the good work.
neg	Absolutely gross-  I'm just going to be bluntly honest- who the F cares what the food tastes like when the place looks like a frickin' dump?  It was so disgustingly dirty inside. Besides food paper trash- resting among the carpet- the tables were dirty the bathroom was out of service and I feared touching anything as I was led to my seat... that's a problem.  I've actually never seen such a messy restaurant before. Let me also say that the restaurant was empty when we arrived and was filthy when we walked in and was filthy when we left.   Obviously no one that works at this restaurant cares about cleaning up between seatings. There's no excuse for a place to be disgusting like this. It's downright unsanitary. You serve food Valle Luna you're a business Valle Luna- keep the place clean for heaven's sake.
pos	Excellent brunch food and great Bloody Marys! They make their own bread onsite which is to die for! Love it. Hate the valet parking.
neg	This wendy's is terrible. I grew up going to Wendy's but recently the whole chain has become disgusting. This one is just a slow disgusting chain. Blah rather eat pretty much any where else.
pos	Chopped Salad was fabulous as was the lamb burger. Service was top rate.
neg	They wouldn't honor pet co's online sale prices.  That's the first time I've heard about this.
pos	Visited this restaurant last week with a groupon special not expecting their best service since I was using a coupon. I was pleasantly surprised on how great the service was!  Our waitress was knowledgeable and friendly which made for a great happy hour!  Their guacamole is great and their assorted chip basket made everything extra yummy!  I'll definitely be returning :)
neg	I would give this place NO STARS but Yelp! wants me to give at least one.   I went here with my boyfriend last night for dinner and next to our awful Bucca di Beppo (Scottsdale) experience I have to say this one is on my list of MOST TERRIBLE restaurant experiences. The service was so bad we didn't even get to try the food!   True Yelper that I am I did my homework before suggesting that we come here for dinner. I saw all the reviews about the \"bad service\"  but I paid more attention to the \"Cheap\" and  \"Delicious Pho\" reviews because after all you can't knock it til you've tried it. Yes the place looks as divey as any food dive gets yes the place isn't as clean as it probably can be but hey all the best pho I've  had (Da Vang Khai Hoan Pho Thanh) has been from some of the diviest pho spots in town.  I was excited.   It was around 6pm and the place wasn't busy (there were 5 other customers besides us and 3 of them were on their way out) so we went ahead and sat ourselves down. The server gave us menus and made her way back behind the cash register.   After looking over the menu for less than 2 minutes (I usually go for the spring rolls + everything pho whenever I visit a new spot) we were ready to order. I tried to make eye contact with our server but she seemed to be preoccupied with laughing and talking with the pre-teen sitting behind the counter with her. I finally made eye contact with her she looked at me and I looked at her and she turned back to her conversation. For the next 15 minutes I tried to get her attention to alert her that we were ready to order - no luck. But then I noticed that both her and the girl she was talking to were looking over at us and laughing occasionally pointing in our direction and laughing some more. I wasn't about to give up because I was determined to try some of their well-reviewed food but after a quarter of an hour spent trying to get their attention with them just laughing and pointing at us my boyfriend and I had enough. The way they treated us was disrespectful and humiliating so we walked out and drove across town to another Vietnamese restaurant.   We are never going back to this restaurant and I suggest you don't either. Just as it isn't acceptable for customers to be rude to restaurant staff it also isn't okay for restaurant staff to be blatantly rude to customers who have not done anything to deserve bad treatment. We did not deserve the type of treatment we got at this restaurant and I am seriously fuming with anger as I write this review. I don't care how delicious and cheap your food is you cannot use that as an excuse to make customers who come in feel like somehow they are undeserving individuals.   Thanks but no thanks Pho House. I don't need to feel disrespected and belittled just so I can try your cheap Vietnamese food. I have plenty of Vietnamese friends who have moms who can probably cook better than you can and will treat us a million times better than your staff did last night.
pos	This is the most comfortable place to have a glass of wine relax and enjoy some great food. Their service is amazing. There are really comfy seats and couches inside and great outdoor seating. You could literally spend hours here. They have wi-fi so you can chill out on your CPU or IPad. The bar super cool. Very nice bartenders that are knowledgable and accommodating. Their wine is killer of course or they wouldn't be named 5th and Wine right?
neg	Okay did I say bad?? WORSE. Negative five stars.  From San Diego 1. they made us wait in line for ticketing. 2. Made us go check our bags  3. Bag agent told us the flight has been delayed 35 min and we have to wait in the \"special needs\" line bc we were gonna miss our connection flight.   4. Booked another flight. Meanwhile got barked at my a brainless incompetent mean lady that was a complete b*tch to us. She told us there was plenty of time for our next flight and that we should patiently stand in line (and miss that flight).  5. Got on the runway. Plane circled around for about an hour. didn't take off. 6. \"mechanical problems\". 7. kept ppl on the plane for another hour. 8. kicked everybody off saying we weren't taking off on this plane.  9. made everybody wait in a long@$$ line that didn't move while we saw a ticketing agent to rebook our flight (while I held up a DELTA SUCKS sign made with pen and crayon on my sketchbook)  10. hours later after not knowing what to do with us they placed us in a hotel in downtown SD. 11. We were to take an 8 PM flight the next day to LAX and then 2 hr and 45 min layover. 12. 11:45 PM plane from LAX to Tokyo.... scheduled 4 AM landing in the far east you kidding me?  13. THEY LOST MY LUGGAGE.   ~~*~*~*~*~*~*~* another incident:  LAX to Tokyo: \"mechanical problems\" stayed another hour on the plane. Had them shuttle us to a hotel in the middle of nowhere. Lost luggage on the way there. It fell out of a bus!  Next morning 8 AM plane to Busan Korea.  Seriously you expect me to go to work on Monday after all this sh*t?! Sorry Delta I'm so exhausted sick and tired of you. F*CK YOU guys and your incompetence and sh*tty customer service  too.
pos	Pita Jungle can do NO WRONG in my eyes!   The food has always been amazing! I have been going here for 10 years or so and have never left displeased.  Also they are a home spun local business which always makes me happy!   Yes they do have hipper then thou hipster working there but those hipsters can sure make a mean hummus!   I have many favorites which is starting to make it hard when I go there because I want them all! Pita Jungles portions are always so generous that I have never even finished what I ordered.   My new fav is the Lentil Fetoosh Salad the mix of the lentils and rice with the caramelized onions over the fresh mixed greens with that lemon vinaigrette is WHOA! Its incredibly filling split it with 2 or 4 friends seriously!   Another fav is off the starters section but its so much food that I never finish! The lavosh pita crisp! Its like a fancy spicy supped up cheese crisp!   Thank You Pita Jungle for bringing bomb diggity food to the valley!
neg	An upscale mexican restaurant in the area seemed like the best thing to have happened to me. I planned my visit for a quieter evening and reviewed the menu again and again.   However upon our arrival I thought twice immediately. The parking was iffy and the place didn't seem to stand up to the signage. Perhaps the art was not to my liking honestly not a piece stands out in my memory.    We were seated immediately.   Our waiter seemed a little off not to mention the fact that he was insanely snobby and seemed to be moonlighting in the kitchen where he disappeared for 10-15 minutes at a time. He did not fill our soft drinks once without being first flagged down (those of you who have experienced the close quarters will understand how ridiculous this is).   Halfway through waiting for our food (which took 45 minutes easily) the lamp above our table went out. We sat in the dark for a good 5 minutes before they even noticed. Which was actually a nice change of scenery from the boring beige walls.   When the food finally arrived we were too tired (due to having finished an entire bottle of wine) so we left. Unfortunately we took our grub with us. I had some sort of mixed seafood entree with chorizo and a creamy sauce. It's no coincidence you're taken aback by the combination... it didn't go down too easily. Having dropped 90 dollars on the meal though we felt compelled to finish as much as we could stand.   Normally I would make sure I got the name of the dish right but since I am recommending that you not go there why bother?
pos	I love the menu here it has many selections of many cultures including Italian!!!
neg	You'll feel like you stepped in a time machine and landed in 1987.  The decor hasn't been updated in at least 20 years.  Looks like it's falling apart.  The TVs are mostly 80s style TVs as well although there are a couple flat screens as well.  This is where the trash hangs out of all colors.  The pizza was greasy (which I like) but also chewy (which was gross).  The wings were drowned so much in sauce you couldn't find them.  Might as well get a glass of honey bbq sauce and drink it straight.  Service was interesting.  The guy that worked there was wearing capri pants and had a higher voice than my girlfriend.  The price wasn't bad- I think it was like $22 for a large pizza wings and 2 sodas.  I'd rather pay a little bit more and just go to Upper Crust pIzza down the street.
pos	The shaved ice at Bahama Bucks reminds us of vacationing in Hawai'i! Lots of flavoring options and a cheap date!  Haven't tried the smoothies yet but we heard they're great!
neg	Unprofessional disorganized and extremely low end care.
pos	By far my favorite restaurant in valley. Deliciously spicey. A bit pricey if you're picking and choosing items but they're complete meals are a pretty good bang for the buck.   Not actually sure about the service as I've only gotten takeout but if its any where close to the quality of food then it must be awesome.
neg	Should be called The Bad Egg. Bottom line the hotel's free breakfast tasted better than this and we got better service there.   We arrived around 945am on a Sunday morning and had to wait around seven minutes to be seated. The staff was pleasant enough. We were seated given menus with water and she took our order for coffee and the breakfast special (loaded potato skillet). We sat for 15 minutes before we saw our waitress again. She finally figured out she forgot to bring our coffee. We finally got some coffee which was mediocre in flavor. Our food arrived about ten minutes after that. The skillet was supposed to contain sausage bacon onion scrambled eggs grilled american potatoes covered with cheese and sour cream. Mine had no bacon two tiny chunks of sausage no cheese and the potatoes were so soggy they tasted like someone had thawed them and thrown them in as an afterthought. It was so unpalatable i could not eat more than one bite even after loading it up with salt and hot sauce. The waitress never checked on us once during the meal. She came back by the time my husband was finished. I told her the meal was horrible (in a nice way). She offered me something else. By that point I was not feeling like eating anything else I felt kinda sick. My meal was comped and we did get an apology. The manager explained that everyone LOVES that special and the potatoes are seasoned and grilled. The cook obviously didn't try my potatoes. Blech. Even with the comp the total was over $15 for one special and two coffees. Very hight priced for nasty food poor service and loud/uninspiring atmosphere.
pos	Hands down the best breakfast I've had in Tempe/Phoenix.   We arrived on a Sunday morning around 9am and had no wait for a table.  The service was friendly and attentive.  A few slip ups on forgetting things in the kitchen (e.g. bringing someone's toast) but our waitress was great.  Everyone in our party loved their food.  I had the Vatican skillet (which we still can't figure out why it's called the Vatican...?) and blueberry pancakes.  Others had the three musketeers omelette and the breakfast burrito.  All of the food was awesome.  And then there was the brandied blackberry bread pudding dessert.  Oh. My. God.  I don't even have the words to describe it.  At least not words that are appropriate for yelp.  It alone is worth a trip to this restaurant.  I'll be back.  Not soon enough.
neg	So not following my own advice (ahem NEVER RETURN) I returned here for a friend's birthday dinner a few months ago (I super love this person so how could I say no?). HA! Big mistake. Also fair warning: there are several-a-CAPS-LOCK ahead.  The only pleasant thing about the evening was the reservation and seating were right on time for our large group (15 people). And of course because we were celebrating a super special person.  I'll keep this update short and sweet:  $3 for a CAN OF SODA? Get real. I knew it'd be overpriced but I was at least expecting a mini bottle or something. But a can? COME ON. You bought that in bulk and paid .03342 cents for it. FAIL.  Your servers: IDIOTS. First it takes our server 15 minutes to come around the first time and take drink orders. Then she's back another 15 minutes after that taking the orders again. Did you forget? Were you not paying attention the first time we around? Why did it take 30 minutes just to order drinks? And on top of that we wait another 15 to receive them. FORTY-FIVE MINUTES TO RECEIVE DRINKS IS BAD. Very very bad.   Also not taking food orders until after we've been seated for ONE HOUR is BAD. VERY VERY BAD. Seated at 8 o'clock we didn't receive our food until almost TEN O'CLOCK. TWO HOURS FOR FOOD IS VERY VERY BAD. Do you hear that St. Francis? BAD.  Because I loathed the place even before this lovely birthday dinner and because the thought of supporting such an establishment makes my blood boil I ordered only dessert and the hubs ordered an appetizer (and add on a $3 can soda). Funny that our bill was still nearly $30 for the both of us. Excluding tip. BAD.  Also server: If you say you're not going to split a check stick to your word or don't even try. Now I'M glad you didn't stick to your stingy \"I don't split checks\" because I could foresee the mess of trying to split a $700 bill with 13 people I didn't know so well. Lucky for us when we told you we were leaving early and asked for our check you split it for us. A couple others caught on and did the same but the remaining 7-8 people were not so lucky.   Because I realize my short and sweet is not so short anymore (or sweet for that matter) I'm ending it here. NOTE TO SELF: heed own advice and stay away from St. Francis!
pos	Absolutely loved this place! My fiance and I came across the Arrogant Butcher while we were in Phoenix celebrating my birthday and our engagement. My fiance had found it on yelp and said \"we must go there for lunch one day\" while we were there. We ended up going here for my birthday dinner after a \"higher end\" establishment couldn't accomodate my gluten allergy. The food the drinks and the waitstaff were great! It was so good we went back the next day!
neg	I give this location no love.  We went to this one rather than the one uptown on a Saturday night with a voucher from another location from a bad sushi upchuck experience.  Going late at night with a mostly empty restaurant we still ended up waiting 10 minutes to be sat then SHOVED and I mean shoved in next to the only other table in the place - the hostess snickered at me when I kindly asked to move a single table down (really sick of bitchy hostesses in Scottsdale by the way - your job is not that hard so shut up and color for christs sake)  Our waitress took another 10 minutes just to greet us sushi took forever and if you can believe it the fun hadnt even begun yet.   When paying the bill we present the voucher to the waitress who says she cant take it.  The manager came over with a bitchy look basically trying to call it bull shyt and continued to give us the 5th degree about it for the next few minutes - certainly NOT appreciated.  She takes it to the point where she calls the other location where we got it (taking ANOTHER 10 minutes) and finally gives us our bill back - only taking off our 2 rolls and 2 nigiri.  This created one pissed off yelper instantaneously.  Don't bother with this location - you could find bomb shrapnel in your soup and they still wouldnt give a damn.    And for the sake of all that is holy - STOP WITH THE CRAZY I'M-TOO-SEXY-FOR-MYSELF SCENE!  YOU'RE NOT THAT COOL!
pos	This is one of the best Asian meals you may ever eat. They are amazingly inexpensive for lunch too. The house fried rice and the wonton soup are perfection. The Lincoln location is prettier but the food is the same.
neg	Qver-priced substandard food.  Never met a cheeseburger I didn't like-- until now (NOT a 1/2 lb.).   Small portions of tired room temperature \"fry-pieces\"  burnt bacon chicken tenders so hard they couldn't be penetrated with a fork.  Mediocre service;  didn't bring kids meal cookie.  Waste of $$$!
pos	Wow love that a place like this moved in down the street.  Inexpensive fresh delicious - everything I want in a mexican restaurant. My soft shell carne asada taco was fantastic -- freshly prepared and topped with guacamole which by the way is super creamy. Basket of chips are free as is the toppings bar -- every one of the 6 or sauces were delicious.  I plan on frequenting Salsa Blanca ; )
neg	What was Dunkin Donuts thinking when they took out the selection of donuts and now only offer a choice of 10.  It used to be you couldn't decide which one to get now you just have to settle for what they have.  This new and improved Dunkin Donuts is the worst.  I will return for coffee when I get the urge...but never for a donut!!   Oh and another thing...my Dunkin Donuts used to have Baskin Robbins inside...that is gone too...again WHAT WERE THEY THINKING!
pos	My husband and I absolutely LOVE this restaurant! Anytime I find myself craving Mexican food the first place that pops in my head is Salsa Blanca. We have always encountered friendly welcoming staff and amazing fulfilling food. What more could you ask for?!
neg	We bought or second Jura Compressa coffee machine from Sur La Table.  It was an expensive model priced over $3K.  After 2.5 short months it stopped working.  The only  option they offered was to send it in for repair.  When I asked to have it replaced I was told the turn around was 48 hours.  Its actually 4 -5 weeks when all is said and done.  I high priced item and thats the kind of customer service. Not to mention an expensive product that cant make it 90 days.  Extremely bad customer service on this one.
pos	Best place in Arcadia to get a coffee or a tea. Lots of friendly locals and great place to sit outside to people watch and read the paper in the morning early lunchtime.
neg	What are you all talking about?! This place is awful. Theres a reason why these sandwiches are $3. I can't believe so many people like this place (although the place was filled with the Chinese people and they have been known to have different taste buds ) You get a 10 inch piece of bread with a bunch of stringy cheap vegetables. From what they said there was meat on there too  however i forgot to bring my microscope to verify if there was any on there. This place is like a middle school cafeteria smack dab in the heart of Tokyo's slums (i don't know any Vietnamese cities). Please homeless people save your quarters you're too good for this place. They have good milkshakes but if you really are homeless (as you should be if you're going to Lee's) you shouldn't be buying \"rich people\" milk shakes anyways stick with the dollar menu.
pos	Best Steak Ever. That is all.    Everything on the menu is amazing. Go now.
neg	This place is pure crap! The players are sub-par and un-entertaining  (especially Mike Clement and Julie Martinez).   and the door men are ridiculously cheesy and rude.  I'm a regular at piano bars all over the country when I'm traveling (Pete's Piano Bar in Austin Howl At The Moon in Scottsdale) and The Big Bang in Tempe is a terrible destination. Save your tips and bar $ for the aforementioned places and take my word for it.
pos	in honor of the impending superbowl XLV i wanted to write my majerles review.   this year though instead of hitting up a sports bar for the biggest day in football i'll be going to a party. a real rager. if i wasn't though i would definitely be pressed up against majerles front door bright and early superbowl morning. it's a great sports bar.  the weirdest thing about majerles is their name. someone finally told me it wasn't pronounced \"mah jer lees\" like i had thought.... it's pronounced \"mar lees\". so let me get that out first.  i'm a big sports nut.... well let me rephrase that. i'm a big sports nut when it involves REAL sports. i won't make fun of anyone but if it's not football baseball basketball or hockey i don't wanna hear about it. unless of course we're talking about extreme sports like surfing skateboarding etc.   being a fan of sports makes me a fan of sports bars. there are only 3 main things i need in order for a sports bar to be great in my opinion. let me lay them out for you:  a good selection of beers happy hour specials and bar snacks--- yes majerles has this in spades. large selection of beers and any sports bar that has perrier jouet vueve clicquot and dom champagnes must be praised.(mostly because i think this is absolutely hilarious. WHO orders pricey champers at a sports bar? haha!) also put me down as a fan of their reuben reuben and tenderloin sliders. yum.  the service--- there's nothing worse than sidling up to a bar excited to watch your team kick some ass and ordering a drink from a bartender that seems bored and unhappy. every bartender i've come in contact with at majerles truly loved being at work (or they at least acted like it). bartenders attitudes really carry a lot more weight then they realize. happy bartender =  happy bar patrons  the strategic placement of large TV sets for comfortable viewing pleasure--- yep. they designed this with real sports fans in mind. no matter where i sit i can see a multitude of TV's with little blocking my view.   so they have it all and i likey. go here if you're looking for a good bar to watch the superbowl... or any sporting event for that matter.   oh and GO PACK GO!!!
neg	If we hadn't arrived after a tiring day and prepaid online I would have checked out.  Furniture missing.  Security bar sheared off.  Faceplates for wiring gone.  Furniture handles missing.  Bobby pins and scraps of things on carpet - hadn't been vacuumed.  Two remaining chairs badly stained.  You wouldn't want to sit on them.  No uniforms or name tags on staff.  Pick another chain.  The reviews for the other Ramada's in the area - which I read after the fact - reflect the same things.
pos	Excellent service!!!! I had to find a spa different from lavenders after they got rid of yet another excellent staff member so I tried this place! I was SO HAPPY!! clean pleasant warm comforting. The manager is actually on site and aware of the things going on in their spa! The staff is friendly and efficient!  Lavenders day spa can learn from this place. Send the owner from lavenders to sanity and TAKE NOTES.  I HIGHLY recommend it here!!!!!! Go and enjoy!!!
neg	Still a place that is unacceptable in my book--especially when a server there goes out of their way to message me privately on Yelp to complain about my punctuation and signing off--every so \"sincerely\" i might add with: \" love the B*tchy waitress from AZ88.  Way to keep it classy over there.....
pos	I live no where near this place & have gone out of my way to eat there MANY times! I haven't been since it moved (bc I had no idea where they went) but it looks like it's bigger so that's great. I even made it a point to take an out of town friend here. I don't know about the new place but the old place was kind of a hole in the wall diner feel (in a good way). It can get really busy at lunch so I don't recommend it for a lunch break from work. I did that once and got in and out just fine but it's a lot more fun without the time crunch. Everything is delicious but the mini red velvet cupcake is always a must!
neg	I understand I'm not dude and so I'm not there to state at your \"twin peaks\" however that being said I am there to buy a beer and when it takes the bartender 20 minutes just to get a beer I'm over it. So I was never gonna come back but was forced with a group of friends who wanted to eat and was just as upset as the first time. Fries were soggy and our server disappeared. We all decided were not going back. Just because your a good looking server doesn't give you an excuse for sucking.
pos	Quick update for Mama Java's since we had the Yelp Office Hours there last week... we lucked out and were able to take over the couch / chairs to the right when you walk in the door.  It worked out perfectly!    Even though I hadn't been in to MJ in a couple of months Jensy remembered that I drank a soy latte - incredible!  I felt so special (almost like a regular) when I walked in and she greeted me and asked if I wanted a soy latte!  I did and it was just as good as last time!  The atmosphere provided the perfect place for the yelpers to come and go chat etc... I think everyone felt comfortable and welcome.  Thanks again to all of you who came by to visit!  Looking forward to the next time...   Lastly MJ created a yelper special of the day... the \"hold me closer tiny yelper' which i believe was a vanilla cinnamon latte.  Now if that didn't make us feel special what does?!
neg	\"No.\"    If you ask me about eating at Papaya Thai that is what I will say.   0 stars for the single kinda scattered and scruffy staffperson.    0 stars for the cook who cannot prepare an offering from the menu as the menu describes it.  In this case I was down to two remaining untried Thai restaurants within quick reach of the Valley Metro Limo and both in Tempe.  The other half was in Tampa and since he does not care much for Thai I get the chance to try one.    The limo arrived at Southern and Mill at 5:17 PM and connected me with another limo at Broadway. With traffic getting to McClintock took nearly 15 minutes.  On exiting the limo 5:50 PM I walked back about half a block to the restaurant.  On entering the restaurant I picked up a menu and rang the bell and a somewhat harried staff person came to greet me.  He asked me where I wanted to sit at a table with 1 bench looking directly into the side of a huge fish tank...or the next table which would leave no buffer between myself and the only other table seated in the restaurant.    There are at least 120 seats in this restaurant.  Why so fiercely contain people in the first three tables close to the door?  You must get your business in fits and hurries and keeping only the 3 tables active is working for you?  Then again your telling me you are the only staffperson does not surprise me.  The Help Wanted sign on the door was more than an indication that Help is NEEDED!  When I was seated staffperson offered to bring water.  The phone rang and he was off as he offered another version of \"I am the only staffperson here...\"  I looked at the menu and made my decision. In the menu there is a $2 charge listed for sharing.  This goes against everything Thai I have ever known.  The traditional Thai meal has everyone enjoying some of each dish served.  Because of my proximity to the fish tank I was quite up close and personal with the fish. The water probably isn't filthy but the plexiglass tank is not helping the perception.   6 PM as the cellphone chime reminds me of the passing of an hour.  I am waiting for water and a staffperson who can take my order. 6:01 the staffperson comes bearing a pitcher of water and a (My eyes are rolling in opposite directions because I am either overworked or stoned) smile.  He filled up my glass and asked if I was ready to order.  I replied that I was and ordered Som Tom the Thai name for the green papaya salad. Staffperson replied that he did not know the Thai names for the menu items.  The phone rang again.  Staffperson's attention was no longer on me.  The phone his Pavlovian stimuli had taken him away.  I asked if he had heard me.  He replied that he needed to go answer the phone.  He asked if I minded waiting as he was the only staffperson.  I said I would wait.  Off he went in pursuit of electronic interaction.    6:10 PM staffperson returns apologizing for the telephone delay and asking about my order.  I ordered the papaya salad without the green beans and steamed rice on the side.  Staffperson took the order and went to the kitchen.  The phone rang as he left the table  his pace quickening as he approached the phone.    6:18 PM the door opens and 2 potential patrons enter.  The bell rings and staffperson rushes to the waitstand to greet 2 new patrons.    6:20 PM staffperson returns. He brings the salad and a bowl of rice.  The salad that appears has some of the traditional salad ingredients along with ingredients that have no business being in the salad.  Som Tom does not have cucumber shredded lettuce or cilantro.  On sending back the initial preparation staffperson returned with the original preparation advising the chef stated \"This is a traditional Thai presentation of the dish\".  I sent the order back citing the inconsistencies and asking for a new presentation.  6:25 pm.  As I empty my water glass the salad I received previously is returned minus the cucumber.  In asking staffperson if this is a new presentation or if it is an attempt to correct the original he replied that he did not know.  I stood and left.  While the advertisement on the window of the establishment says they have \"The Best Curry in the Valley\"   they will get no second chance to prove it to me.  For all the phone activity there was no one who came to pick up a carry-out order.  Between this and the somewhat glazed staffperson I have to wonder if this place is not a front for a drug business.
pos	It's been a while since I was in Arizona but I still remember the Olive and Ivy.  I was in Phoenix on a business trip and went out for dinner at this place with a bunch of work people based on a recommendation from a local.  We were not disappointed.  Firstly I want to say that the decor and outdoor area in this place is just fabulous.  We sat outside and enjoyed a delicious meal.  The staff were professional welcoming and accommodating.  I enjoyed the experience so much that I brought the gf along for dinner when she arrived that weekend.  Both times I was extremely pleased with the food drink level of service and the ambience of the place.  5-stars for mine.
neg	ok let me be straight with you. i hate paying full price for anything. yes i'm one of those people. i love a coupon. i love a discount. and i absolutely love a bargain! but i don't like to feel dirty when i leave a store. i felt really really dirty when i left this store. ewwwwww. this is a yucky ross. dirty dirty dirty! the floors and clothing racks were filthy. i couldn't have bought something even if i wanted to because the store was so gross - i got black \"stuff\" on my hand after touching a clothing rack. the floor was so discolored i'm not sure what the original color was. parts of the store's floor were sticky. many of the clothes had indistinguishable marks on them presumably from the dirty hangars and racks they are stored on. selection was meager there wasn't a single shoe bag wallet sock or home decor item that caught my eye. the trip was a waste of an hour that i'll never get back. never ever again.
pos	Great little hole in the wall with authentic New Mexican food.  Chili Relleno was awesome and the red and green chile was flavorful and spicy.  Rice and beans were good and the sopapilla was delicious. Atmosphere was cozy.  If you want real red and green chile vs. sauce this is the place.
neg	I'm not sure what all of the buzz is about because this place wasn't that great! I had the grilled cheese and it was hard and dry!  There was this nasty drunk guy who sat across from our table and it was quite sickening! I will not be going back!
pos	I just stopped at Biagio nail place today and got my mani and pedi done it was fabulous. Tiffany gave me great feet and my neck massage. She does really job. The shellac manicure was really nice she gave me a lots of different colors so she actually helped me find the colors that i like and I was very happy that I got her. I will Go back and ask for her...
neg	This place is the white-trash Chipotle. The food is mediocre at best. I mean seriously how can you just up and steal Chipotle's idea! There's no creativity there. The Habenaro Salsa is flavorless and not hot at all. Seriously? I asked for HOT not some yellowish tomato concoction for the people who can't handle real salsa!  At least Chipotle has hot salsa (not too hot either but much better) for a fast Americanized mexican food. Of course I much rather have the real deal but I do like Chiptole for what it is. Not this crap that Qdoba tries to serve up.  The chicken is over seasoned and highly spiced/herbed you can barely taste the chicken. The Fajita veggie were the same. The product looked of very low quality. Oxidizing Guacamole and Lettuce. The meat looked unappetizing as well. Just not at the level of Chipotle. Although I have been here twice this is the last time for me. I have been to one in Denver and for some reason thought it was better. So maybe it's management but I can say the food is less than good. I much rather go to Chiptole than this wannabe! Employees were dumber than a bag of Frijoles! This place has the worst \"Mexican\" Food I have ever had next to a pre made burrito from 7-11 or a burrito from Taco Bell. Just disgusting food.
pos	This is one of my favorite places to go in Phoenix!! I love the $5 wine glasses during happy hour!! The bruschetta is out of this world!! The sundae with salted caramel and pretzels is probably one of the BEST things I have ever eaten!! :o)
neg	Price reflects quality and service.  5/2010 purchased wedding gown brides maids and mothers (bride and groom mothers and grandmothers) dresses.  Girls were rude and our brides maids dresses seems and straps fell apart just before the wedding.
pos	The food in this place is indescribably awesome! Granted the place could be nicer but if you're in the mood for great food without the frills of a great looking place: this is it. The service is fast friendly and the prices are great- especially knowing that their portions are typically huge. I can't finish my plate most of the time so I always end up taking leftovers home.  I love their Jade Red Chicken as well as their emerald chicken. Their black beans are to die! Order a combo plate if this is your first time here. You'll get a good mix of everything and you'll leave without regrets!
neg	First off I would like to punch the dip Shit on the food network who said this was the best chicken he ever ate. Yeah the place is filthy but how they operate their business is redicolus. Service sucks 49 minute wait for the food sucks waiting 20 minutes from the first  entree being dropped off until the last person luckily receives their food sucks being told on the 59th minute of a hour wait for your food that they are out of your side dishes sucks spending my hard earned money at a place that is Ass backwards in any kind of business sense sucks. At first our group thought it was a joke then the reverse racism theory was brought up then we noticed that every table was experiencing the same lack of service. Black white purpleorange. They just sucked.
pos	everything everyone has posted about this company is true! great service friendly people good pricing! highly recommend!
neg	The staff at this location was rude and unfriendly!! Also the store itself was not the cleanest I have seen!
pos	I don't love the coffee at Starbucks but this place is getting 5 stars for their service! They are quick ACCURATE friendly and they always remember my drink even though I only go there about once a week! Amazing! The staff is great and I thought I should leave them a nice little \"Good Job\" on Yelp!
neg	Very nice location but food was awful.  Had a chicken salad yuck.  Service stunk big time!
pos	This place was incredible.  The staff was friendly not pretentious and very knowledgable. I don't know what it was called but our group ordered a tray which was a sampler platter and had a bit of everything on it.  So fresh!  We also tried the sushi with the caviar on top.  Try the sake that they recommend (flown in from Japan - they are the only ones in PHX that carry it).  I'm not a sake fan but I loved it.  That's how good it was.
neg	I don't expect much when grabbing lunch at a mall but I expect better than this.  The seaweed salad was a generic overly soy tasting disappointment the rainbow roll was barely worth eating - the shrimp on the roll tasted fishy the fish was mealy-textured and the rich was soft and too sticky.  The yellow tail roll suffered from the same and we luckily were cautious enough not to try sashimi.  The miso soup was served barely like warm.  The tea was served barely luke warm. That was when we finally got service which took a veritable eternity.  Tea refills?  Good luck on getting someone's attention for that.  The inside is a dismal cavernous sport-bar/pool hall sort of feel.  Basically no redeeming features here.
pos	Monkey Pants has some of the best burgers in AZ.  Great place for a long lazy lunch over some pitchers.  I think one month my friends and I went there like 20 times for lunch.  Never got sick of it.  It's a dive bar but it's a cool dive bar.
neg	Wish I could rate negative stars.... With so many bar choices this place is by far the worst.  Last Saturday a group of friends went out for a friend's birthday celebration in Scottsdale and decided if we split up that we would meet at the end of the night at Loco Patron. It was increasingly obvious that the staff was hostile and irritated that they could not close up early. We finished our last call drinks and started to head out. The friend who was celebrating his birthday waited behind at the bar until his friends left the bathroom. At this point two bouncers became extremely agitated at our friend and demanded that he put down his drink and leave. My friend started to explain his reason for not leaving (friends still in bathroom) but was quickly cut off. I watched from the patio as the two bouncers (both obviously larger in height and weight then my friend) quickly escalate from talking to both grabbing my friend under the arms and start to carry him out. As he was carried backwards he lost his balance and tumbled back with both bouncers on top of him. The bouncers slammed him down headfirst on the cement outside of the establishment pinned him down with their elbows and hit him. At this point I had run behind the bouncers and was yelling at them to get off of him. I had already taken out my phone to call 911 and I quickly tried to take a picture to show that they were using excessive force. We demanded to see the manager at which point the bouncer said he was the manager and refused our request. He swiped my friend's phone down out of his hand and broke it on the ground. Several people had called 911 at this point and we waited outside for the police to arrive. The police arrived and took down the bouncers' information and stated that they would be recording this incident.   I am absolutely adamant in saying that neither I nor my friends will ever frequent Loco Patron again. We were treated disrespectfully by untrained staff who were either too eager to close up to get home or get a power high by manhandling non threatening non physical patrons of their establishment. Based on the behavior of the two bouncers I assume that this bar operates without any written guidelines on how bouncers should conduct themselves. What I witnessed was full on assault and an infringement on human rights and I plan on writing any regulatory agency I can think of. These people make a bad name for all of the bouncers out there that conduct themselves within the guidelines of the law.
pos	We were in town for the weekend and I had a cigar at this lounge.  The cigar prices are reasonable and I didnt mind paying $9 for a La Gloria Wavelle.  Service was good and the atmosphere was nice and chill.  My Wife doesnt smoke cigars and the air circulation was good no lingering smoke.  We met some nice people and the lounge singers were a plus.  We will come back next time we visit I wish we had something like this in LA.
neg	This place used to be amazing.  My favorite memories of past years is going to this seafood place with my parents.  It's not the same anymore.  We went for my wife's 30th birthday.  My dad decided to join us.  My wife ordered steak and shrimp my dad ordered steak I ordered a crab stuffed lobster.  I have had the crab stuffed lobster many times before.  I was craving it.  We got our appetizer's.  Dad got snails wife and I shared steamers.  My dad was happy with the snails.  But then again how can you go wrong with snails doused in garlic and butter?  The steamers were steamed little neck clams in a garlic broth.  It was not long neck clams like the rest of the world calls steamers.  I wasn't about to argue with the server that these are the wrong clams.  The food came and for the first time in my life I was asking the server to take back my meal before I even tried it.  It looked dry and over cooked.  I told the server I've had this dish many times before and this is not the way it's supposed to be.  He told me this is what it's supposed to look like and begged me to try it.  I took one bite and I couldn't even swallow it because it was so dry.  Of course the server was gone by this point and didn't come back for 10 minutes to ask me how it was.  While I was waiting for the server to return I told my family I was just going to get the steak.  They just shook their head and told me not to.  I took one bite of my dad's steak and spat it out.  How do you screw up steak this bad?  It tasted like beef jerky and butter.  My dad and wife would have complained too but it's my wife's birthday and I am already stealing her thunder.  I swapped my meal out for a steamed lobster.  How do you screw up a steamed 1 1/2 lobster?  Fortunately that came out fine.  So we left hungry and $300 poorer.  I used to not mind paying the money they charged but now it is not worth it.  I am really hoping people stop coming here so they can just close down.
pos	Where else can you get fresh lemon grass fresh pork uterus and avocado ice cream?  Asian markets are the bomb but Lee Lee's is the BOMB DIGGETY since they have EVERYTHING.  Jamaican Cuban Vietnamese Korean Indian Lebanese---you name it.  If you love to cook (and I do I really do!) you can seriously spend hours here.    ONE CAVEAT:  The seafood is fresher and better at 99 Ranch on 44th St. in Phoenix.  Last week they were giving a 10\% discount off of your grocery bill and a free bottle of fish sauce or soy sauce.  If you spent over a certain amount you got a big bag of rice.  Go!  Now!  And have lunch in the Vietnamese restaurant attached.
neg	Maybe I ate at a different restaurant than the other people or once they got through the \"soft opening\"  they gave up because this place was not good.  The service was mediocre at best they seemed scattered and unfocused took five minutes to get water.  I gave up on ordering anything else after that.  The food?  Bland hamburger that was cooked perfectly in the center.  Too bad that outside of the center inch it was completely overcooked and dry.  Soggy duck fat fried and average sweet potato fritters.    Let's talk about this \"coal oven\".  While the burgers are cooked in a coal oven you could tell by the smoke hanging over the restaurant they are cooked in an iron skillet i.e. pan fried!  The coal adds absolutely zero to the burger.  Overall if I am going to spend $10 on a burger with no sides it better be perfect and this wasn't.  I would also hope $5 would get me more than two fritters.
pos	This is my FAVORITE place to dine out in the greater Phoenix area. The food (I recommend the steaks) is almost as good as the view and the service is impeccable. My boyfriend took me here on a date a year ago and it was definitely one of the most romantic restaurants we have found in Phoenix yet.   The prices are a little high ($25 - $40 per entree) but it's well worth it and you won't leave disappointed. If you like American or French food (who doesn't?) and have a special occasion or just feel like doing something different I highly recommend Different Pointe of View to everyone!
neg	Ugh.  My tip-off should have been the Guy Who Saw Me Reading The Menu and came outside to tell me the food was good.  But I was craving Chinese I work near the COFCO center and it was threatening to rain.  I scanned the menu found Kung Pao chicken and ordered up.  They told me 5 minutes and they were accurate.  Price was reasonable.  Waiting area was comfortable and well-decorated.  Food was inedible.   I got the lunch special which include soup egg roll entree and fortune cookie.  I couldn't eat any of it.  The soup (hot and sour) was way too sour.  I felt like I would get acid reflux if I ate it.  I couldn't order the fried rice because it contains peas (I've learned to ask...childhood trauma).  The rice was clotted together and difficult to eat.  The kung pao chicken contained a suspiciously generous amount of meat...so much so that I questioned whether it was actually chicken.  I watch too many movies.  The egg roll was just gross.  It seemed like the wad of mushy veggies was wrapped in biscuit dough before it was deep-fried.  The fortune cookie was stale and the fortune was even lame.  I would've done better to get soaking wet and hit up Panda Express.
pos	Dropped into this joint just wandering around Old Town Scottsdale. Ordered the nachos and had a couple margs. WOW. The staff was friendly have a great sense of humor (you gotta see the posted picture joke in person) and the food is...beyond good. Having only sampled the uber nacho plate which is by the way as big as a platter and slathered in layers of ooey gooey cheesy goodness I can definitively say:   Best.  Ever.   I give this place the highest marks for \"doesn't suck\"
neg	Good prices but this please is honestly not worth the hassle. First of all you have to leave your purse at the counter. I am not comfortable doing that anywhere. Who does that? The only place I have ever seen this before was ASU's bookstore.   Then you walk in this warehouse that has NO air conditioning!!! I made the mistake of going yesterday in the middle of the day (111 degrees out yikes!) Then you get inside and you have to carry a catalog to refer to for prices since items are unmarked in large boxes.   If they had a/c it would have been worth it to save a few bucks on the toys my dog destroys in minutes but no air conditioning??? IN ARIZONA?? Madness!
pos	If you ever want to instantly \"up\" your cool factor with a friend or date meet them at the Lost Leaf. The mere fact that there is no external sign (other than the tacky \"open\" sign indicating that it is indeed the lost leaf) you would probably never have any idea that the best neighborhood bar in Phoenix is inside. When i am asked to describe the lost leaf to someone who has never been before it is basically a big open house with the most well-stocked beer fridge you have ever seen.  No cocktails or draft but for atmosphere and quality of beer selection lost leaf is by far my favorite place to meet people in dtown phoenix.
neg	Here's a thought don't post on the door to your restaraunt \"Up scale Mexican Food\" unless you can prove it.  This was not upscale it was barely pass-able  as decent.  Didn't help that the waitress got both of our orders wrong.  Will not return.
pos	This is my favorite restaurant in the Phoenix area. There I wrote it...and I am sticking to it. First off -- fresh local sustainable organic are not just words on the menu and the website. Now in places like San Francisco and NYC this would be nothing notable but in the desert it is truly something hard to find. Aside from the practical in the land of Fox Restaurants (True aside) and the big box store at the strip mall there really appears to be little demand for a small local restaurant on a farm. It's time to make new demands! It's time to say no to the next Zinburgergeist and try that little corner place run by your neighbor...but I digress.   We enjoyed the Farmer's Feast and it was worth every penny of the $65/person. First the house cured meats including the head cheese were amazing. Second how often do you get a chef's menu where each person's plate is different? Not often. Ultimately we each tried 10 different items. And each item was amazing. I would come back for the pasta alone let along the perfectly cooked scallops and melt in your mouth sliced fillet.   The service was ideal. If you want to eat in 60 minutes don't come here but if you want to enjoy in evening of great food do come here. I noted to the waiter that the previous night they had sturgeon -- something I haven't seen on a menu since N. California. I commented on how unique it is etc...Of course it was not available on the night I was there...or was it? When it came to our fish course the waiter brought out sturgeon for me. The restaurant didn't have enough to have it on the menu but the waiter clearly put in a special request on my behalf and made the effort to make a diner happy.   Maybe if I offer to work on the farm I can eat for free...
neg	I only ask for two things when I'm flying. To land safely. And to not fear planes while on them.  US Airways only delivered on one of those and I'm still undecided on the first one. Took a flight late from PHX to SFO. Two hours isn't too bad. Unless of course it was the longest two hours of your life and you could hear people in the cabin praying for their lives. I understand that turbulence is normal. But I would rather you cancel another flight because it is too dangerous to fly then to put passengers through the scariest flight of their lives. Oh and when you finally do land and are thanking your maker that you are in fact still alive its probably best that you don't have to overhear the pilots saying \"Wow that was scary. I'm surprised we landed alright.\" Morons. They should pay for the trauma I'll have for the rest of my life.
pos	Matt's was absolutely fantastic. Got there at 2pm on a Sunday which is apparently the time to do it (half an hour before close) as we walked right in sat right down and had food in 5 minutes or less. Brilliant.  I had the Five Spot which was simply the best egg sandwich I have ever had. Two eggs two huge slices of perfectly cooked bacon american cheese (my favorite with eggs when I'm not going fancy-style reminds me of when I was a kid) and well grilled onions round it out served on a fantastic roll.   By default this item doesn't include the normal potatoes and toast so I had them add homefries--they were magnificent and entirely unnecessary. A huge portion of them with a wonderful smattering of rosemary to punch them up they were delicious but I couldn't finish them.  The girlfriend got a waffle with bacon and it should just be said that restaurants who serve waffles without real maple syrup are simply criminal. Matt's brings the good stuff and it's MUCH appreciated. Perfect for dipping both waffle and bacon alike. The waffle was fluffy light and had that good homemade flavor.  I can't get over how filling and delicious my sandwich was. Service was prompt and friendly and overall it was a great experience. Added a glass of OJ and a coffee to my sandwich with added homefries and her bacon and waffles bringing our tab to right about $21. Absolutely worth every penny. Will be coming back. Probably near 2 o'clock again to avoid the wait!
neg	I had one of the worst experiences of my vegetarian life here. I had been to Johnny Rocket's before and gotten the vegan option so I knew I would be ok going here. I was out with my meat eating sister and my pescatarian husband so I figured this place would be the best for all three of us to get what we want.   We get in and I ordered a burger that wasn't the Streamliner (1st mistake) and just ordered it with the BOCA burger. The waitress takes our order my husband also ordered his with a BOCA.   About 20 minutes later the food comes out. The patty looks right. I was a little apprehensive and I should have gone with my gut feeling on not eating here this day but I ignored it. It had been awhile since I had eaten a BOCA patty (over a year) so I THOUGHT it looked right. (2nd mistake)  I start eating it and about half way through it the bill hits our table. It was crowded in there so the waitress must have been trying to get us out of there. So I look at the bill and notice both my husband and my burgers say Turkey substitution. I immediately start to freak out. We call the waitress over and explain to her that we ordered BOCA why does it say Turkey? She then tells us that it is BOCA it just says turkey. I say no that doesn't sound right. So she goes to talk to her manager I guess because we never saw her again. The manager comes over to our table and apologizes profusely for what happened. I'm upset because how the hell do you confuse BOCA and Turkey? I mean really. I know some people might think how did I not know the difference. And I thought that to myself as well but the truth is it slipped by me even though it shouldn't have. And it hurts me every time I think about it. I will never come to this Johnny Rockets again if any of them ever again because of this experience.   All I can say is if you are vegan or vegetarian and you go to any of the Johnny Rockets make sure that your waitress/waiter knows that a BOCA burger isn't meat. Stress that to them. Because obviously they aren't trained to know what the difference is.
pos	This is by far the best Chicken Fried Steak around!  Not to mention their mashed potatoe's salad and biscuit!  I've never been able to clean my plate here which is great since I always have an extra meal!   Of course you can always get the lunch portion which is smaller but then you don't have the extra goodies for later!    It's a small down home place dress comfy and go there to eat up!  The wait staff is always the best and they know their stuff!    I've had their T-Bone here and it's good but really hard to go there and not get what made them famous!  Wonderful food!  Prices for lunch are around $7.00 and dinner around $12.00 - really hard to beat for real down home cooking!
neg	Don't know where I should start. Grand opening was on September 17th 2010. We went to try this new Dim Sum place at the Mekong Plaza as they heavily advertised in the chinese newspapers and were advertising 30\% off.  When I got there the biggest eyesore is that they tried to make their portion of the Food Court as a regular \"Chinese\" restaurant. So imagine the picture of chandeliers hanging in the middle of a food court in the mall. It just looks too tacky I thought they should've went with a more fast food type Dim sum like they have in San Gabriel California.  Upon checking in with the hostess they don't even issue numbers they only call you by name. So that was already pretty different from how usual chinese restaurant run things. Totally not efficient at all.  Once we finally got a seat things got worse.  Our \"Har Gow\"/Shrimp dumpling was raw! The skin was thick and clumpy the shrimp was severely undercooked. We asked them to exchange for another one and it was still raw. We also had to exchange the shrimp egg roll as it was also raw. Their excuse was that they were too busy and did not have time to fully cook the food. Ok.....so how are the other 100s of asian restaurants able to serve dim sum at a fast pace with fully cooked food? That was probably the lamest excuse.  The trademark \"beef internal organs\" that I always love to order was pathetic. They charged the large price for a tiny little bowl there were only a few tendons and mostly filled with Daikon.   The BBQ Pork bun another staple of Dim sum was not that great either. There was barely any char siu in the bun and the exterior of the bun was not fully cooked.  I understand that it is their first operating weekend but the idea of a nice chinese dimsum place at a food court just doesn't fly in my opinion. They even offer wedding banquets here too.   I don't think I'll be returning here unless they really upgrade the quality of the food. The idea is definitely novel but will be a hard sell.
pos	I love the place.  Was a bit hesitant at first but friends recommended it and it turned out to be quite good.  They even have a few choices for those that aren't into Asian fare.
neg	We ordered.  I had to return my chicken tenders.  Undr cooked and rubbery.  My wife ordered a hamburger and is now home throwing it up.  what a horrible experience.  We have been huge fans and now this?  I called and spoke with someone who barely has a grasp on our language and they said they would get right back to me.  Still waiting My wife is in bed looking so sick.  We will never return!!
pos	I ate here once while Crudo was still in its Scottsdale location.  And I raved about it and vowed to come back (although the strange location in a salon delayed that return).  Then Crudo disappeared.  And I wondered how a place that fed me one of my best meals in Phoenix could disappear in a town supposedly full of foodies.  Now it has reappeared and in a better location.  Oh joy.
neg	Hot Breakfast..........NOT Again cold food when it supposed to be hot....people beware of this over price place and lack of care for the customer it seems that this is the way of doing business.  *** Again a nice place to visit but DO NOT EAT HERE.*** And DO NOT CARE!
pos	BEST RESTAURANT IN AZ!   No but seriously I could eat every meal here. Chef Becky is amazing and breakfast this morning did not disappoint. I decided to try the Organic Oatmeal and my friend ordered the Red Velvet pancakes. Ok so you're probably saying \"with all that yummy goodness you ordered oatmeal?\" Well what I really wanted were the chilequiles (eggs cotija jack pulled pork tortillas tomatillo verde? Yes please!!) but being allergic to eggs I went with the oatmeal which was delicious. The oatmeal had a vanilla flavor to it and the strawberry and pecan topping gave it some texture. The red velvet pancakes are too intense for words. Rich fluffy...they'll make you want to get up early on a Saturday morning. I also tried a side order of the banana bread which was slightly toasted....now if you've never toasted banana bread you need to. This was the perfect buttery flavor combination with the oatmeal.    The service was fast as always--we never had to wait or ask for a coffee/water refill. The decor inside is warm but I think sitting outside on the patio is the way to go.   Love the Herb Box and can't wait to go back and try the cinnamon buckwheat pancakes.
neg	Some of my friends brought me here last night and the first thing that came into my mind was that this was a set up for To Catch A Predator. I was ready for Chris Hansen to pop out and grill me with \"What are you doing here?\" If you feel like Kubrick's Lolita really speaks to you as in it mirrors your life then you've found a place to feel comfortable in your pervert skin.  If you're of age to consume alcohol they've got a bar here. The thing about this bar though is that they're really sloppy about pouring drinks ie. a Manhattan should not taste like a barber's cleaning solution. The decor and set up of this place really needs a face lift.  A few pluses though... If you're under 21 I could see how this would be appealing. I'll admit that the under-21 clubs that I went to when I was under 21 were fun but now that I think about them they really suck. It seems like an alright experience if this is your first step into the club/bar world. The DJ's here spin pretty much straight hip-hop which is fine it's very mainstream though and nasty bumping music.  If you go here you're one of three types of people:  1) You were dragged here by your friends 2) You're under 21 or 3) Your usual excuse is a heart-felt plea complete with waterworks that goes something along the lines of \"I swear Officer I thought she was 18!!!!\"
pos	This review can be applied to any and all Quick Trip locations.  I have on many occasions gone out of my way to stop in QT over other gas stations because not only are they much much nicer but they are very clean and offer a ton of gas station fare (drinks shakes coffees juices snacks etc).  I really appreciate how quickly they work with cashier's that are able to take care of two customers at once.  I usually abhor using gas station bathrooms because let's face it we've all been there and seen how putrid they can be but whenever I visit QT they are always clean! They mop sweep clean the bathrooms windex the doors...and for that I applaud you all thanks for the cleanliness:D
neg	in addition to sucking it's also expensive.
pos	What a place!  I recently hosted a 25-person family party there and both the food and service were impeccable.  The staff were all very friendly and accommodating even with the dozen children we had in the group.  Leslie was the manager and she paid attention to every last detail helping me to plan the menu and gauge food quantities for that many people.  The restaurant itself was spotless from the outside patio down to the restrooms.  Thanks for making our family event such a wonderful success.  Everyone left full and happy.  We will definitely be back!!
neg	Our bartender was rude and impersonal to start. When my wife ordered a diet coke you could see her disdain. We saw her once more when she took our food order after which she sat in the corner and ate. The remaining staff dropped off our food without a word and never came back; in fact I had to flag down the manager to get cashed out. The food was sub par. My wife's Shepard pie was all mashed potatoes and my chicken strips were incorrect and with the wrong side. Also my fries were soggy because they had been placed over excess sauce.   Poor food awful service overpriced beer. Visit the Kyrene location or don't go at all.
pos	Oh my God Chompie's is the bomb and I'm so happy to have a location so close to my house!  While this location has a steady customer base I have never had to wait longer then five minutes to be seated unlike the other location at 92nd Street Win! Service has always been fantastic. Quick on to seat quick to get drinks quick on refills and delicious food from breakfast to dinner items. As other reviewers have stated the Jewish sliders are amazing but I have also enjoyed different wraps and sandwiches. Prices are a little higher but the food is well worth the money. There is a \"bar area\" with about six stools and two TV's that you are able to see from your tables/booths which usually has ESPN on.   The restaurant itself is all decked out in a NYC theme well lit but the acoustics aren't that great so it can get a little noisy. Bathrooms are nice and always clean. Oh and don't forget to check out their bakery for delicious goodies to take home!
neg	Worse pizza I have had in a while. We ordered 3 slices and they tasted like they had been sitting out for a while and nuked. Crappy service too. Salad was plain and all oil no vinegar for dressing. . Service half ass. I am surprised they have remained in business fo several years. Also they apparantly have no AC it was VERY warm inside even on a slightly chilly day in Nov so we sat outside the inside was so hot and stuffy. this place totally sucks.
pos	Great sushi place!  Ample portions of sashimi.  Unagi is the best I've had.  And don't forget the Tako salad.  The atmosphere is okay.  It's not bad but not exactly cool.  Of course if it were 4 miles south (in Old Town Scottsdale) you'd never get a table.
neg	I just finished my G & S meal that I ordered to-go; actually I just finished throwing it out. It was HORRIBLE. And by horrible I mean shamefully bad. And by shamefully bad I mean heinous! I had a very disappointing experience here about a year ago but I thought I would give it another try. I should have proceeded with caution when I asked the long-term employees at the neighboring Blockbuster what was good and to the person they all stammered and failed to reply. Seriously zero out of four could give me one \"great\" dish! I've lived in both Mpls & Chicago and my Ex used to travel the Orient and we were always surprised at how POOR the quality of Asian food was in this area and WHY the people here seemed to like it!? It's absolutely baffling! I had the Orange Beef & Spring Rolls. The Orange Beef looked scarey right in the container. But when i ate it - UGH! The texture was all off and the sauce..... it had these big clear GELATINOUS ..... ugh ugh ugh! I can't even talk about it. Like biting into a ball of corn-starchy orange extract! I'm still sick from those few bites! [Truly.] And while I ordered vegetable spring rolls I got what tasted like low-quality hamburger meat! In fact I finally identified the flavor and texture as: SAUSAGE! It was like an Asian Spring Roll with chunks of Italian Sausage inside!! How's that for a combo? Ugh...... [stomach turning] I'm sorry I'm a Single Parent and I'm usually grateful to have someone cook for me. Grateful even when i am paying. But during \"tough times\" when i actually \"treat\" myself and then plunk down $20(!!) for unedible... yuck - it's totally TOTALLY unacceptable!  Shame on you George for offering such little quality control and not aspiring to a higher standard overall. No wonder the place was (not) hopping on a Saturday night! Simply one of the worst meals EVER.
pos	Careful! You'll get addicted.  Angel Sweet is the best gelato this side of Italy.  The pana cotta and zupa flavors are to die for. Don't settle for just one either you can get as many flavors as will fit in your cup!
neg	NOTE: This review concerns the Roberto's on Union Hills and 7th Ave. NOT the Roberto's in Anthem!   I am only giving it one star because I can't give it 0. Simply put i was very sick after dining there recently. This was the only meal I did not share with my family and therefor the only culprit to my food borne illness. I have enjoyed this place in the past but recently the quality has gone downhill. Now they are closed on Sunday's.  I wish i had read recent reviews on here before i had gone. they have slipped VERY far since there Diners Drive-ins and Dives days.   the guy that both took my order and cooked my food was obviously drunk. sitting on his cellphone playing what appeared to be a video game when i walked in.
pos	I can't believe I hadn't been here before yesterday!  Talk about a hidden gem!  I was taking a friend around to cross stuff off her \"List of Stuff to do Before the World Ends\" and smoking a hookah happened to be on it.  Therefore I googled places nearby us and Oasis popped up.  As soon as we got there the guy at the door welcomed us in with a smile and opened the door for us and once inside the waitress/bartender helped us pick a table and took our drink orders.  We decided to get the peach hookah and an order of the Hummus and Pita Deluxe with beef.  The food was delicious and the hookah was great!  The staff was awesome the entire night as well.  Everyone kept checking on us to see if we needed anything and they would just stop and chat with us as well.  One guy was even helping my friend try to make smoke circles!  I definitely love that they're open until 4 am on Fridays and Saturdays too because it's always nice to have somewhere to wind down after all the bars close!
neg	After stepping off the plane hungry I looked around the terminal for food as I walked to the next gate. \"Wait a minute I'm in Arizona. I should get some southwestern style food or mexican food. Is that a burrito place? Surely it can't be bad.\" I ordered a #1 standard burrito. I take a bite. And another. \"Not bad I thought.\" Then I took another bite. And promptly spit it out.  The cheddar cheese in my burrito was moldy. And no I'm sure it wasn't blue cheese. It was even obvious visually. After pointing the cheese out to the manager she brushed it off as \"the bag was just opened it's not possible\" even after showing the obvious mold. People around me started looking uncomfortable. Someone muttered \"wow\" and stepped out of the line.  The best part? I wasn't even offered a refund or a new burrito or an apology for the moldy burrito. Are you kidding me?
pos	My meal at FnB last weekend was one of the best I've had in Arizona. I love everything about this place the food the cocktails the staff the atmosphere.  It was a rainy Sunday. I knew the restaurant was right next to Cowboy Ciao but managed to walk right by it (my friends noticed me go by). I turned back and Pavle was nice enough to wait at the door and said \"Ben?\" as I was about to pass by again. I agree with what everyone else said here Pavle really makes you feel at home.  I started with the slivered fennel salad and a ginhound. I split the order with a friend and they were more than happy to bring the salad split  onto two plates for us. I love citrus and these were a very refreshing start to my meal.   Next up was the trout. It was presented stacked on top of the sunchokes and caramelized onions with some wonderful broth on the plate. The combination of flavors was rich and amazing and the presentation ensured that every bite was as good as the last. I could eat this every visit but I sampled the chicken and lamb and was just as blown away. For desert I had lemon cake with ice cream and strawberry compote.   FnB has been receiving a lot of positive buzz lately. It's well deserved. If you haven't visited yet you're missing out.
neg	I used to love Quiznos.... I would go out of my way to get a turkey bacon guacamole sandwich any day. At this point in my life I will no long be giving any money to this sorry excuse for a sandwich shop. The staff is rude and careless. I was given obviously bad guacamole... Which I didn't realize until i got home a took a bite of my sandwich to have the fowl taste in my mouth. It took 20 mins to get my sandwich there was only one couple in front me. I'm done with this place. I should have went to paradise bakery across the street.
pos	So my coworkers and I decide we want donuts on a Weds. I know typically donuts are on Fridays but what the hay. In my search for a really good donut I go to the Internet and Google \"best donuts\" and low and behold Bosa Donuts comes up. They have 3 locations and the one in Chandler has 12 reviews which all raved about how great Bosa Donuts were. So I notice they have a location at 35th Ave and Glendale! I had seen it many times but never stopped in thinking it was just the average run of the mill donut shop. Boy was I wrong!  Bosa Donuts is by far the best donut I have had in a very long time maybe ever! I stopped by for a dozen this morning and bought a little something special for myself. I got to the car and took one bite and was in heaven. The what I would call a Cinnamon Fry with crumb topping was to die for. What I liked the most was it was not greasy like some other donut shops. (I won't mention any names you know who you are!) Lightly crisp on the outside and so tender on the inside. The crumb topping was just the icing on the cake. It was all I could do not stop and get some milk so I could utterly devour the rest of my donut on the way to work. I did have a bite of an Apple Fitter after getting to work and it was very yummy too. They have many varieties and some wonderfully looking croissants too. If you have not tried Bosa Donuts in Phoenix you are missing out!
neg	MY EXPECTATIONS WERE EXCEEDED!  I've been searching for so long to have a dinner experience that MET all of my expectations - for a restaurant that I SHOULD NEVER PATRONIZE.  Mimi's in Goodyear actually exceeded my expectations.  On Oct 26th while visiting the area I made the unfortunate mistake of recommending we dine at Mimi's because of previously good food and service there.  But alas if the old Mimi's quality still existed they wouldn't have exceeded my expectations for WHAT NOT to experience in a restaurant.  Let me recant why YOU or ANY ONE ELSE (except those people you truly dislike) should never patronize this facility.  First of all the interior temperature was at least 80 degrees (when it was less than 65 outside).  We had to ask for the air conditioning to be turned on.  Next we ordered the artichoke dip appetizer.  It looked funny.  It tasted funny.  The tortilla chips actually resembled pita chips.  If it walks like a duck quacks like a duck it must be a ______.  I ordered the chicken cordon bleu which is supposed to be served with \"seasonal vegetables\" and \"homemade mashed potatoes\".  Can someone explain to me how MIXED seasonal vegetables can be served where the brocolli is steaming hot but the carrots mixed with them are literally still frozen in the middle?  That's a feat.  My \"homemade\" mashed potatoes?  Cold.  A sliver of butter placed on top of the mashed potatoes would not even melt to graphically show our waitress \"the problem\" .  Even after this effort no offer from the wait staff (or manager-missing-in-action) was ever made to either warm up the potatoes replace them ......or perhaps use them as wall spackling.  After all this they sincerely asked us if \"everything was all right\" and \"would we care to order dessert\".  At least they have a sense of humor.  Never again.
pos	Papago has a great beer selection & awesome food. Try the Orange Blossom!!
neg	The location has closed (AGAIN).  Not good if you have prepaid washes or other credits as the business has closed.  Some speculation on other sites is that they have filed for bankruptcy again.  Don't bother stopping by to use their services as the facility is cordoned off and a big sign says \"business closed\".
pos	YUM!  I can never remember what it is but order the salad thing on pita bread!  It will change your life!  My co-workers and I would always go in here and share one of those and then we'd each get a slice of pizza.  Perfect amount of food- low prices- never too/disgustingly full.  Their bilinis are wonderful as well!
neg	First off the woman who answers the phone is not impressive at all.   I called to consign my furniture and when I asked her about some info on the store she said \" do you want to consign your table or not!\".  Quite rude.  That was a turn of for me..... The next day I went in the store for some info but when I entered I knew this wasn't the right fit for my Robb & Stucky table.  The place had older style furniture..dated couches florals mauves.  There was one accessory that I would  buy in the whole store.    Needless to say I won't be coming back or consigning my table or anything else...rude stuff + gross stuff...what more can I say!
pos	Best Italian restaurant in the valley as far as I'm concerned. Totally unassuming from the outside since it's in a strip center on 64th St. & Greenway (in the same center as Fry's and McDonalds). But this family run restaurant that has been here for years. Same friendly staff every time...especially love being in the bar area. A little on the pricey side but definitely worth it. Must try the ravioli (either as an appetizer or main dish) and chicken Marsala with fettuccine Alfredo on the side. All entrees come with soup or salad.
neg	I have only been going to LA Fitness for about 6 months. I live in Scottsdale and work in Phoenix so I go to the 20th St & Camelback Scottsdale and Oak and McCormick Ranch locations.  The Scottsdale locations are GREAT! They are clean the staff is really nice and I see people cleaning the equipment when they are done.  What is it with the Camelback crowd?  The place really smells bad! It really needs a good cleaning. There has been this big spot on the carpet in front of the womens locker room since I started.  I was on the treadmill the other day really noticing how stinky it was and then the guy next to me finished up and just walked off I swear he was sweating like a pig left the equipment drenched! UGH!!!  Good God! I couldn't believe it Can't the employees make these people clean after themselves?? The reviews are right about the staff just hanging around at the front desk.....they should be cleaning something anything.  It really is a shame that this centrally located facility is a real stinky mess!!  I can't wait for the new one to open on 7th Avenue! Maybe then they may clean up their act.
pos	Yelpers  have a question. If menus and prices vary by location help this CA transplant figure out the best ones to try! Thanks I've heard such good things about Sonic but have only been to the Anaheim and Hemet CA ones while visiting.
neg	Ok I'm very surprised by the reviews on here. I'm not one to want to write negative  reviews but our food was so bad I couldnt help myself. Maybe this place was having an off night tonight but their pizza barely had any cheese on it and the crust was soggy. Unfortunately the pizza was better than the wings that were overly breaded and soggy as well. Thank God we had a groupon and didn't have to pay full price. Won't be ordering from here again. Disappointing :(
pos	May I add \"family friendly\" to my past reviews? We love this place because we feel like we are home when we come here. The staff is kind and they always welcome us with open arms. The manager Kaj literally treats us like family. We brought our new born baby to Corbin's for her first meal out and we were thrilled with the level of service we received as usual. The food is excellent and the service is divine. The happy hour is awesome! My favorite items are the quesedillas burgers feta and hot sauced topped homemade potato chip appetizer and the excellent selection of beers. Corbins is just an overall  great place!
neg	This location is now closed.
pos	I was extremely happy that we chose Cool Cuts 4 Kids for my son's first big boy hair cut. He was instantly comfortable and drawn in by all of the friendly things they have for children. He was given the choice of a movie or playing a video game of course knowing exactly what he wants went straight for the video game (Sonic on XBOX). It was pretty much a breeze from that point the little guy was hypnotized and didn't even realize what was going on w/ his beautiful lovely long hair =( obviously they need to focus on distracting the mom's lol! Jessie who cut my sons long hair was a doll she didn't seem to be bothered by the mother breathing down her neck as she hacked off my little's hair or the boyfriend taking a copious amount of pictures and video of the whole event. In the end my son looked great and I was a happy mama I couldn't have asked for a better experience.
neg	Why can't the attendant understand a simple direct question?  Can someone please tell me just where the Hell I'm supposed to put my freakin' drink?  and worst of all ... my balls don't fit in this place.  *one extra star for the bartender offering me her personal lighter  *minus the extra star for not having any matches
pos	Amanda at Butterfly Petals did the flowers for my wedding. I didnt want to spend  a lot on them and shaved it down to only needing my bouquet three boutonnieres and two corsages. I told her what I liked and didnt and my budget. She created a bunch of options for me based on my specifics so I had a  number of choices. She also did all of this via email. which I give her total kudos for.   On the day of my wedding there was a fabulous bouquet waiting for me as well as perfect corsages and boutonnieres for my groom and our parents. Amanda waited for me even though I was terribly late to make sure I was happy with her creations which really gave a personal touch.  Butterfly Petals is creative and affordable. I love my bouquet so much that I ended up keeping it and I am having it preserved!
neg	Out of business
pos	I loved this casual dining experience at the gorgeous Phoenician.  I stopped in for happy hour with some friends and we had a great time.  We sat in front of the fireplace and sipped beers over appetizers.  The location alone is worth going for but the food was good and service was even better.
neg	Ok Im giveing Del Taco one more chance....  I go in what is your best chicken Idem....  um Burrito or taco? he asks  Have you had the Burrito?  no....I haven't had ethier...  Have any one eaten anything here? I ask the rest of the resturant crew....they All shake there heads no....  ok so even if the food was discounted or free no one should ever eat del taco.....regardless I did eat a burrito.....  and my worst fears where confirmed....I could have dumpster dove at a taco bell and gotten better food......  Feed me bad food once shame on you.....Feed me bad food 4 times Shame on ME....
pos	This place has the best wraps I've ever had.  The smoothie's are good as well but I go here because of the wraps.
neg	Overcrowded sprawling mess of a mall (and I normally like malls). Traffic and parking are almost as bad as at Tempe Marketplace. The confusing layout makes it hard to find specific stores (even with the help of the directories).
pos	I stopped by a Friday morning a few months past and have been meaning to write a review. I've had donuts since then from other donut shops but none compare to Bosa. The price and quality at Bosa are far superior to all others. You can't go wrong with the donut holes.
neg	The bill was 150.00 and that was after a free appetizer coupon they sent me via email.  The food was no where near worth the HIGH price!  The service was not up to par either.  I really can't believe people pay such high prices for food that come with NO sides etc.  I got iced tea to drink and it cost a whopping $6.00.  That's right folks....6.00 for a glass of tea.  What is that 100\% profit/mark up?  I paid 12.00 for a soup sampler.  Each of the three soups were in a tiny espresso cup.  My salmon was no better than what I get at Texas roadhouse but it was three times the price.  I would definitely not recommended this place.  If you want a fancy awesome meal go to Houston's!  The one thing that was great were the rolls (they were free too)!  Don't get me wrong the food is good but not worth the price tag!  You can get just as good food a lot of other places for a lot cheaper!
pos	Amazing place wish i lived in Phx so i could have this EVERYDAY!
neg	One star for the most terrible service in recent memory.  Our server \"DK\" was outright rude and horrible and outright ignored us when she wasn't making us uncomfortable.   As a former waitress of 14 years I have the utmost respect patience and tolerance for my former bretheren - but this woman needs to go.  BAD DK!  Otherwise our Teppiniyaki (sp?) chef was wonderful the food was delicious and fresh and a solid four stars.  I have been going to Kyoto since 1995 and it remains a fun and festive place with very reasonable prices.  Too bad it was ruined this time by DK!   DK needs a different job more suited to her personallity like euthanizing kittens or something.
pos	One of my favorite places to eat if I'm looking for cheap and fast :)
neg	Entering the store is visually overwhelming. There were so many things take in I thought I'd found my new grocery store.  I wandered for a good 40 mins checking everything out....  After the ether wore I began to realize something. While the selection was wide it look OLD.  I raced to the fresh fish and noticed that even packed in ice their little fish eyeballs where cloudy and sunken into the sockets.  I looked at the frozen section and found some fish that had a sell by date of 02/2010. There was other fish that was packed by the store  with no packed on or sell by dates. There was canned and boxed food past their expiration date.  I checked out this place on the Maricopa County health department and they had their fare share of customer complaint driven inspections.
pos	I love this place. Just to hang out on a Summer day on the patio and have a beer is like...the perfect day.   The food is awesome. The Kilt Lifter is tasty and thirst quenching.   The area is definitely lucky to have such a place.
neg	Slow service staff needs more training. There's like 4 managers and none of the know what they are doing i don't think this place is going to make it. Sorry but you lost 4 very good patrons Saturday night because of your poor customer service
pos	Yes... I love Eegee's... I have to admit it could be a bit of a problem for me as I drove from Chandler to Casa Grande just for an eegee and sammich in the worse rush hour traffic. If that isn't love I don't know what is because we all know Arizona drivers are ... well you know. I always get the pina colda mixed with lemon eegee and a grinder / or turkey sub and don't forget the ranch fries! The one is Casa Grande is new and clean not that I can say the same for the ones in Tucson.
neg	Waffle House was packed Over heard another couple taking about \"Fast Eddies\" With a 20 min wait ahead of us we decided to try it out. Walked in looked like a senior center. Tables and chairs were very out dated. We sat down in a booth. Food was still on the table and the cushions were dirty. Waitress came over after 10 min and asked what we wanted to drink. 10 min later she brought out or coffee. Placed the order waited another 20 min to get the food. The diner wasn't busy at all. I don't know why the wait was so long. The food was ok service was horrible. One thing that really grossed me out was the a/c return next to the office door. Look up and you will see probably years of dust that has collected. I showed the waitress and she really didn't care. I told her that if I would of saw that when I came in I would of just walked out. GROSS! Sorry Waffle House I will never betray you again.
pos	Totally worth the drive from Scottsdale. The food is delicious and is not pre-packaged such a nice change for a coffee joint. Support local business Starbucks has nothing on Lux; other than a million locations.
neg	This place has the oiliest food I've ever eaten in my life.  I had carry out one evening (two dishes) and the entrees were soaked in oil.  I had to rinse with water my eggplant dish three times just to eat it without feeling sick to my stomach.  I wish I could've washed the other dish too (but it wasn't one that could be washed--it was a wide-rice noodle dish).  Can definitely taste the MSG in these dishes too.  Really not sure what the fuss is about.
pos	The management thanked me profusely for my input on Yelp and graciously invited me to return as a guest to show me the true Latilla Experience. I was told changes have been made because of reading my YELP review.The changes are that dinner portions are more ample than before the appetizer plate share charge is gone now and I noticed the web site has been updated. This visit showed little resemblance to the service I had last time. A full staff was on with staff working in sync as a team with all the tables not just mine.  I was even more blown away with the food than the last time due to perhaps I picked foods that were more suiting to me some highs were-  Beet salad- it was similar to others I had in other places but this one also had HOUSE GROWN BEETS Riesling soaked pears and the toasted hazelnuts made the salad  pop with flavor.   Foraged mushroom rissotto-correctally made with a depth of flavor it was good on it's own but this had an added embellishment of a SIXTY TWO DEGREE duck egg.   Nicely seasoned and prepared fresh branzino sat on top of ribbon cut caponata an unusual surprise was the vinaigrette and the ribbon cut string less celery that was very good.   We also enjoyed the Kobe Flap steak with wine reduction and tiny marble size multi color potatoes and tasty spinach.  Since we skipped the interesting desserts last time we had to try one this time and tried the chocolate hazelnut cake with jam-figs and mascarpone gelato this dessert was garnished with a chocolate sort of lavender crisp and roasted hazelnuts. This dessert was something Iron chef worthy for sure with all the flavors working well together.  The service we had was phenomenal.  The food at Latilla is masterfully done the surroundings are majestic and breathtaking. The meal we had wasn't ordinary it was extraordinary!
neg	My husband and I heard great reviews about this restaurant and we decided to give them a shot. One word can describe this place GROSS!!! The food sounded great but then you took a bite and ewww disappointment. The salsa was lame the chips stale. There were only two good things about this place the soda and the waitress was nice. Other than that don't waste your money GO TO ABUELO'S...it may be on the west side but it never disappoints.
pos	5 stars for bein the only bar in Phoenix where I was first scared to order a drink. but- thats why I love this place. That and its near the Trunk Space.
neg	Nice facilities nice AC but two FATAL flaws:  1. Children running around yelling and screaming at all times.  This is a failure of the parents and more importantly of the staff who apparently REFUSE to enforce any kind of policies against noise whatsover.  To parents and staff: THIS IS A LIBRARY *NOT* A DAYCARE!!!!!   2.  The \"collection\" here is 90\% DVDs and \"Dummies\" books with trashy novels thrown in for good measure.
pos	Lux is a great place for coffee bakery items bites and even cocktails if the occasion permits. The people are friendly and it has a great atmosphere.  I love coming here in the afternoon for a cup of their Americano which is pretty damn top-notch. As I don't live in AZ if I'm going to be away for an extended period of time I'm always sure to take a bag of their freshly-roasted coffee beans from wherever with me.  I was there last week on a Sunday afternoon having some darn good mimosas with a friend and it wasn't too crowded.  The only downside I've experienced is it can be a bit confusing where to order for food and cocktails during the day.  If you go for the first time don't be shy. Grab a cup of coffee and explore. As one of the earlier reviewers mentioned you might get looks walking in like you shouldn't be there. Maybe it's your hair. Maybe you're displaying something that's not eco-friendly. Whatever dude. Be brave press on. It's worth it.
neg	The wash ain't bad....but the process to get it done is pathetic.  The ticket writers at the entrance move in slow motion. They try to upsell at every opportunity.  Four cars backed up waiting to order their service...and the crew is standing around with no cars going thru. I'd rather drive my car dirty then endure the agony of incompetent management.
pos	I was in the middle of a dilemma and needed proof of something faxed to me right away and stopped in here and got what i needed within just five minutes and was outta there and back to what i needed to take care of.  The price for two piece of paper for the fax was almost $3 which while is not the cheapest considering you can get it for free at home but beggars cannot be choosers and was happy to pay it.
neg	I guess this is an east coast/midwest thing because I really don't get it. I'm not a picky eater and I HATE wasting food and money but I could not finish my plate. I ordered french toast and I was not aware that my french toast was going to be deep fried. Seriously when I put my fork through it a piece of fried toast hit me in the eye. My husband was also not impressed with his food. If someone would like to suggest something delicious on the menu that I should try please let me know because I currently want to vomit every time I see a Chompie's.
pos	My mom had purchased a Groupon for this place back in March and yesterday we were all deciding what sounded good for lunch. I suggested Mexican so then we were thinking which Mexican restaurant sounded good. (Living in AZ you know there's MANY to choose from) So my mom suggested going to Blue Adobe so all of us headed there.   My mom my dad my sister my nephew and I all thoroughly enjoyed our meals. I had the Triple Stack of New Mexican style Enchiladas. One shredded beef and two Carne Adovada. It was SO delicious! The red sauce at Blue Adobe is unparalleled and unlike any other. My dad had the Chorizo stuffed Chicken Breast and loved it. My mom had the seafood enchiladas with halibut salmon and shrimp and she inhaled those. And my sister had the Chile Rellenos and couldn't stop saying how tasty they were. And my 5 year old nephew loved his kids cheese enchilada. Our server was named Travis and he was great as well. Phenomenal service. Even if Travis had been sub-par I would still give this place 5 Stars because that's just how good the food is.
neg	Shocked this place has 4 stars. First off you can always tell if a Mexican food place is good based on the beans and the salsa. Well guess what both suck! Eat at el molino's and you will never come here again!
pos	This place is excellent.  Hands down the best tacos I've had.  Fresh and flavorful meats and great salsas.  I see people raving about some of the \"salsa bars\" at all of the 'berto's and such but the salsa there is like water compared to what Tacos Atoyac has to offer.  They care about what they are serving and take pride in their craft.  If you like the style of food here you must try Sonora Mesquite Grill on 46th Street and Thomas.
neg	sslowest drive through ever!!!
pos	I totally love this place. It reminds me of the old school hardcore Chinese restaurant my parents used to take us when we were kids :D   The decor is amazing- unlike more Chinese places in Phoenix. The walls are a teal blue adorned with large carved pieces of artwork depicting scenes in China golden dragons and more. The lights hanging from the ceiling are amazingly ornate. The place looks like its from a bygone era (doesn't help that its in a run down strip mall) but it is clean and charming inside.  The service was great- kind to our 2 yo and very attentive. The food was the best part- I can't remember the last time I had such good Chinese food and it's priced very reasonably. We got the Peking dinner for 2 which included the fried noodles hot tea wonton soup (with generous noodles meat shrimp and veggies the best I've ever had) a pupu platter with eggrolls bbq skewers house wings and those cheese puff thingies (the presentation is pretty cool too). Next came 3 entree sized plates of food: mongolian beef fried chicken (can't remember the name) and the Peking fried rice. The meal concluded with incredible little desserts- sort of like eggrolls but filled with banana and then covered with crystalized honey. I could have eaten 100 of them! Adding in a beverage and tax the meal was only $34!   My 2 yo can really eat so I am surprised and pleased to say that even with sharing the dinner for 2 people with him the 3 of us walked out with lots of leftovers. Highly recommended. Do it! DO IT!
neg	I am furious.  In the last 12 months I have had at least scheduling issues from them calling me at 8AM on a Saturday morning (my 1 day off) to cancel my 11am appointment to last Saturday when I went in only to be told someone had messed up and actually booked me for the NEXT week and despite me driving all the way out there at 11am they couldn't get me in until maybe that evening and then not with someone who had experience in deep tissue/medical massage. I was irritate and ready to ask for my membership refunded then but Ashley the clinic manager promised me that they'd give me my next week appointment free of charge and that she'd personally be certain there were no more issues.  As I literally couldn't turn my head to the left due to pain I took her up on that. BIG MISTAKE.  Yesterday (the Friday before my \"correctly\" scheduled massage I went out of my way to call in and confirm my own bloody appointment to try and avoid last week's debacle. According to the woman who answered the phone it looked like my schedule therapist was actually scheduled off but she went to talk with her manager and came back to the phone telling me everything was ok and that she'd call with any issues. Then yesterday evening I got ANOTHER confirmation call from Massage Envy confirming and reminding me of my 11:30am appt on Saturday with my preferred therapist. GIven that I've had 3 migraines this week (versus my 0 or 1 when I get a massage the weekend prior) I really absolutely needed to get in so I felt more confident.  Well I was just woken up at 8am...again. On my day off...again. To explain to me that big shock they messed up my scheduling again and that apparently my therapist was off today. Despite Ashley's promise of it not happening again. Despite me being pro-active and calling to confirm. I am sitting here in pain so furious at this repeated treatment that I can't even go back to bed...and the best part? They don't even have a manager on duty I can complain to.  My treatment at the hands of the booking/front desk staff has been any thing BUT relaxing. I continue to walk out of there frustrated angry and occasionally in tears. I know they say Fool Me Once Shame On You Fool Me Twice Shame On Me but I was trying to give them the benefit of the doubt. I'm pretty screwed for today and the next week but luckily an Elements place with a similar concept opened recently in the general area. At this point it literally cannot be any worse than massage envy. As much as I love Talisha and Aisha as massage therapists getting a massage should feel good and not like you're just a number to them not like you actually have to spend more time trying to get a damn appointment than you actually get to spend IN the appointment.
pos	Great prices and service. The delivery process could be improved but for the price and peace of mind with the Costco warranty process you cant go wrong.   High quality furniture and very low prices.
neg	Decided to give Tempe Marketplace another try after reading recent reviews (hoping that they had improved). I had to ask myself if we were visiting the same place. The traffic and parking situation are still horrible and the loudspeakers in the parking lot are unacceptable. The JC Pennys and Targets are crippled versions of their regular stores at other malls. The stores here all open too late (11am REALLY???) to be useful in our uber hot summers (except for a Targets that opens at 8am).  Even though I am a Tempe resident I will continue to choose the Riverview shopping area on Dobson over this mish-mashed monstrosity.
pos	I have been going here for years.  The staff is always very pleasant the place is nice and clean and they offer a variety of services.  I also like the $5 kids haircuts on certain days.  Overall a top notch establishment.
neg	One hour. That is how long we waited after ordering before we decided we would rather eat anywhere that wasn't here. A crushing impressively underwhelming experience in lack of service.  We arrived found we had free valet parking? With a teensy parking lot this works thank you. A good selection of indoor and outdoor seating? Also a plus. Setting expectations and/or taking care of waiting customers? FAIL.  On a beautiful AZ autumn morning we came here (tho we entered Rockerij). We asked to be re-seated outside because inside of Rockerij is dark as a tomb and had loud conversation intruding music. We were reseated by the fireplace and a waiter came over shortly to take our order. Bam. So far so good...or so we thought. 30 Mins after placing our order I ask another waiter to check on the status of our food and he cleverly asks about what we ordered (exactly)...so we think it is being taken care of. 40 MINS after placing our order I have still only had my coffee refilled once...and had to flag down another waiter to inquire about the status of our food again because our actual waiter is nowhere to be found and the previous \"drive-by\" waiter never returned. A few mins beyond that this guy actually comes back and indicates that our order is nearly ready and should only be a few minutes longer. Shortly thereafter OUR waiter stops by with comments of:   \"I don't know why it's taking so long...\" and \"I put the ticket in right after I took your order...\"  So...as a waiter...maybe it might be part of your job to check on the status of an order say...15mins after bringing it by the kitchen? Perchance? What do you think?  FIFTEEN (15 == few?) minutes later we still had no food and I'd had quite enough. Out the door we went.  On a comical note: As we were outside (another 5 minute wait because the valet had our car either parked in Egypt somewhere or tandem?) our waiter came out to find us to let us know that our food was ready if we'd like to come back inside?  Oh R E A L L Y? The Clue-Delivery Train will be visiting you shortly. Facial cues you may want to look for in the future are: 1) the furrowed eyebrows 2) fuck-you facial expression and 3) curling fists  It seems that we are not alone in this. Courtney W.'s review (10/14/12) is representative of what we experienced.  I am dumbfounded how they have any good reviews. There must be a serious drought of sit down restaurants in this part of town because this crap would never fly where I live. I cannot tell you how much I am looking forward to NEVER COMING HERE AGAIN.  P.S. They own 3 restaurants apparently: Richardson's Rokerij and Dick's Hideaway...all right in the same area (Rokerij and Richardson's being attached).   P.P.S. They all serve the same menu. It is NOT amazing. I have previously been to Dick's. Yes it is good. No my socks did not come flying off.  P.P.P.S. ProTip: Drive down to Central Phoenix and go to Durant's Portland's Switch or Fez. All of these places have exemplary service and food to match.
pos	I have been going to Salon Mila for 12 years.  I will never go anywhere else.  My hair always looks amazing when I leave.  The color and cut are always perfect!  I feel glamorous and beautiful when I leave.  First class salon!  Beautiful surroundings!  Always great service!  They aim to please!  Mila knows what it takes to make sure her customers feel welcome all the time!  Thanks everyone!
neg	As I promised myself I'd go back again to try it again. Yyyeeaahhhh...sooooo....the food is still not good. I got the mongolian beef and it's like \"wha? really? is this IRL?\"   I'm a chinese food kind of a fan this restaurant I'm not a fan of.
pos	Just did take out.  Great experience.  Easy to place my order over the phone friendly service.  Nice that they have special pick up parking spots and entrance.  Made it an in and out operation.  Ordered the gluten free pizza with pepperoni and sausage.  My husband and son loved it and have already been asking to get it again.  I had the spaghetti calzone and was in HEAVEN.  I highly recommend it.
neg	Nice looking place with average food and horrible service.  Everything took forever and no one came by to see how we were doing.  We literally watched our server going around setting tables and taking napkins off of empty tables rather than making himself available to us.  He wandered around from table to table in a completely unoccupied area of the restaurant the majority of the time we were there.  The food was luke-warm and nothing special.  I was only here once so I hate to be so down on the place but based on the other reviews my experience sounds pretty typical.  Don't waste your money.
pos	As a previous reviewer stated:  \"This restaurant is like no other\".  We had a birthday celebration and we couldn't have chosen a better place to eat.    First of all the service is second to none.  Every staff member that we encountered was very professional and happy to explain the food and answer any questions we had.  They obviously like working there because they were all so upbeat and smiley.  You feel welcome as soon as you step in the door.  Now for the food - fantastic!  I ordered the four course tasting menu and everything was superb.  My husband ordered the ribeye steak and enjoyed every mouthful although the portion was a bit on the small side.  But in between each course came a little treat of creativity from the chef so that's something we've never encountered before.  For example we each had an espresso sized cup of a creamy soup that was so delicate and delicious that we were wishing for more.  They also served us a little savory doughnut about the size of a dollar coin that was oh-so-good as well as little cranberry \"shooters\" that had little teenie squares of jello (not really jello of course but a fruit gel of some sort).  Somewhere in between everything else we were also served a prosciutto mousse that was smooth and delicate.  As the meal drew to an end they again brought out a little taster and this time it was piping hot mini cinnamon souffles with a creme anglaise on top.  For dessert I ordered the goat's milk panna cotta that had a marmalade bottom and alongside were orange grapefruit and strawberry segments and to top that off the server drizzled honey over all.  Fantastic!  We didn't consume any alcohol but we did have a nice bottle of water and purchased two coasters ($10/each) that flash colored lights when a glass is placed on them.  The total was $169 including the coasters but not including the tip so it wasn't an inexpensive night but it was well worth it.  I can't wait until the next birthday celebration!
neg	HORRIBLE service - did nothing to correct our experience.  On July 7 2011 my date  and I arrived around 6:30 pm well dressed and ready to enjoy a celebratory dinner without any financial limitations. We would have easily spent $250+.  Instead after an hour of being seated  to review our menus we were never offered more than a cocktail.  Tables around us were receiving quality attention by other servers...complete with the run down of the specials house favorites answering questions etc. We on the other hand were lucky to have our make server look at us much less take us to the next step our level in our dining experience.  When the table behind us seated a good 15 mins after us received bread before we were my date and I decided that was our tipping point and would not stay any longer.  When our server came to ask if we were ready to order we informed him  we would not be staying for dinner  and would like the bill for the cocktail.  Never once did the server apologize offer what he could do to make things right etc.   Needless to say we were stunned. The hostess thanked us for dining on our way out...again we both gritted our teeth with frustration. However later we discovered that after an hour of sitting in the dining room we were there long enough to enjoy a meal. It's unfortunate we never got the opportunity to however.  What did go right was...we were promptly seated and the cocktail server provided decent service.
pos	Been here a few times and the food is always fresh and tasty.  I am Chinese from northern China.   This is authentic northern Chinese cuisine.  Food is not fancy but extremely delicious and satisfying.  Highly recommend the Zha Jiang noodles (meat sauce with hand made noodles) the chives and egg pocket and dumplings.  Good prices and comforting home made Chinese food.  Owners are very nice.
neg	They served us stale rice.  Average main dishes not as flavorful.  Not enough meat in the lamb dishes.  Overpriced.
pos	Much more organized than the last time I was there and I noticed more price systems vs having to ask. The even had the new Color Club halo hues I have been hunting for!!! They had 5 of the 6 colors and they were the highest priced polished in the store at 6.50 a pop!! Still MUCH cheaper that the 11$ everywhere else. No striping tape!!! Although the owner did say he had ordered it before and it didn't sell well...... I just went down the street and got some...:)) yay candy cane nails!!!
neg	Not lesbian/gay friendly at all. I should have read the previous review before going.
pos	Stopped by here for lunch today... I saw the Burger sign outside and thought I would try it out. WOW!! This place is amazing. The owner/chef was taking the orders and was super helpful and friendly. I had a Paradise CHZ which came with 2 patties smoked mozzarella lettuce tomato caramelized onion as well as cucumber. I also ordered  Sweet Potato Tater Tots I was blown away! BEST BURGERS IN PHOENIX!  Our bill came to $18 for 2 cheese burgers 2 sides and a soda.  It was so amazing I went back for dinner. I bragged to much when I got home that my boyfriend just had to try it. I had the special which was a Roasted Duck Burger (2 beef patties topped with roasted duck caramelized onions bacon fried egg over easy served with duck au jus) By far the best burger of my life. My boyfriend got the Beach House (2 beef patties. roasted green chili smoked mozzarella pico de gallo and jalapeno ranch) He also ordered the seasoned fries. I don't care for fires and I think I could eat 3 orders they were so good. His was so good he ordered another burger.  For Desert we shared a Maple Pecan Bacon Milkshake also to die for. I really think I need one of these every night. From the atmosphere the music the staff to the food every thing about PV Burgers was a hit. This is a must go!
neg	We used to go to this UPS store quite frequently and had been satisfied with their service but it has been at least a year since we regularly patronized the place.  However we had a really unprofessional experience here recently.  We went there for rotary services for purchase of home which one employee refused to do and handed off to another employee (because as she under her breath notary services were a pain).  This employee could not help us either as \"he had never seen anything like it and he didn't know  want to  have anything to do with something that had power of attorney on it.\"  I guess we are one of the first people around here to sell a home. While we waited for this man to do something the employee who handed off our paperwork tried and failed to scan a document to email and was quite verbal and (sorry) hickish about these \"stupid\" machines.  After looking at all was going on we didn't want anyone here handling our notary services.  Eek - felt like we dodged a bullet.  Also don't think I will be going there for any other services.  I felt like my IQ dropped 20 points when I went in there.
pos	This is place is a weekly trip for us as my girlfriend loves the salmon and martini's they serve here. We have been frequenting this place ever since we moved to the area versus the rare trips we would take for the awesome cream cheese chocolate cake made by Caroline or the lunch Caesar chicken sandwich. Here are my ratings of each dining point I consider when going here:  Service: 5/5 Fast and very helpful Even the chef will dig up custom stuff and cares what people think of the new entrees.  Ambiance: 4/5 The place used to be a home so it's a little cramped but nice nonetheless. Not as comfy as some others like Ticoz but we like it. As it is small in seating ranges you can't get too loud so keep the rowdy folks to the Applebees locales.  Drinks: Ginger ale and the kiltlifter is nice as well as the blackwidow and black / blue martinis.  recommended Food: Fish 5/5: My girl's favorites are the halibutswordfishmiso salmon with basmati rice she also loves the spinach and asparagus. Sandwiches: 5/5 for roast chicken with green chili side of coleslaw or balsamic salad 4/5 chicken caesar is good but sometimes is hit and miss meatloaf: 5/5 best I have ever had it is a beauty. Tacos: 4/5 One time I had pork tacos they were the best ones I had tasted the next time they were ok then the last time they were great not sure why but still recommended. Cream cheese cake: 5/5 Made from local baker who used to do deserts for Circa 1900 but now does it for them and Urban Bean to name a few. Steakchicken pork: 3/5 I have tried each and every one here and while you wont be disappointed there isn't a wow factor like the meatloaf. The sauces seem to not match or compliment the specific meat in my opinion. I would love a bordelaise sauce or onions and mushrooms with the filet for example. Appetizers: ?/? I am not a fan of  the bruschetta but haven't tried the rest. I have heard the crab cakes are awesome but have yet to compare them to Fez's awesome versions.   Pricing is on par with Sophie's but less than Christopher's and more that Ticoz. I am fine with it as the food I order is totally worth it.
neg	This place is disgusting!!  The bun was dry and stale.  The veggie burger was yucky... I don't think I have ever had one I didn't like before.  The kids meals are miniscule.  The topping bar is so simple and plain.  The dips are not very good... cheese dip is YUCK!  Drink choices stink.  Cookies taste raw and boring.  Almost forgot to add that the two young kids didn't even care for the french fries because they are seasoned.  I thought they were a total waste of calories.  I can't believe the prices either... so not cheap or even worth what you pay for.
pos	I LOVE THIS PLACE!!!!  I have tried several of their subs and although they are all delicious the Chipolte Cheese Steak (it's the # 43) is my favorite!  It is the MOST DELICIOUS sub I have ever had!!!  The bread is always soft and fresh it is extremely filling because it's stuffed full of steak peppers and cheese!!!!  To make it absolutely the BEST sub ever have them add some of the little red chili's to it (I think they call it chili relish)....OMG!!!!!
neg	This is one of the franchise store of Ritz Camera in Chandler. The store's staffs are nice however their photo lab is miss leading. They make the price in very small fonts and hanging on the ceiling.   For the first time user to print photos in the lab I was charged for $45 for just few 4x6 and 8x10 print without sign-in as member. I asked for canceling order prior they print the photos. I was told \"Too late\" even it's still in one of their store pc for ordering prints.   Since they are franchise I should be able to return or exchange the accessories I bought for my Nikon D70S camera in different store. I was told \"No\". I can only exchange or return to the stores I purchase them.   I will not buy anything from them again.
pos	Great food. Great ambiance. Great for a night date on the patio. I can't wait to go again.
neg	I wish I could rate this place higher but my blow out is terrible. I asked for a blowdry with lots of volume and curl. It seemed that the cross between the mai-tai and cosmo would be perfect. My hair is flatter than what I walked in with. My hair is curly naturally so has decent volume but for some reason its flat! Also the stylist pulled my hair alot while blow dryng and apologized for hurting me which I appreciated but have never experienced with a blowdry before. I don't think I'll be coming back sad since I love the concept and the salon is lovely.  Update: They offered me a make up blow out. I decided to try the place out again thinking it was a fluke that my blowdry was so awful. Mistake! Not only was my second blowdry here mediocre I ended up paying for the service. I wrote to their manager who had offered the complimentary blowdry but no response.
pos	You know that scene in Fast Times at Ridgemont High where Jeff Spicoli takes one of his Vans off and hits himself on his head? Well that's what I did when I went to this place for the first time.   Why haven't I been coming here for the last 10 years this place is great!!!    I would say this is the best non-Pizzeria Bianco/Cibo pizza in the valley.  The crust is awesome sauce and cheese just perfect!  The really impressive part is is how picture perfect the pizzas are made.  The lobster ravioli were huge easily enough for two.  Baked Ravioli's were better that average but needed more basil or something.  You really can't dine here so it's take out or delivery.  They have one table and a few other seats inside if you had to eat here I guess you could.
neg	Well I guess the bar is much lower in Flagstaff as we went to their restaurant in Glendale for breakfast.  It was less than mediocre.  Starting with the coffee which tasted awful..it was very bitter and watching the waitress pour old decaffinated coffee into a regular coffee pot! Unacceptable.  I had bacon and eggs...fair. Asked for the hashbrowns to be well done..didn't make a difference I guess as they came out raw.  Also asked that my toast be dry...came out saturated with butter.  My husband had the chicken fried steak with gravy...you could have plastered a house with the gravy!  As you can tell we will not be returning.  The reason we went was because of their article in the paper this week.  Just shows that you can't believe believe everything you read.  My husband \"jokingly suggested that we cancel the paper!
pos	Jeremiah is great! He is very friendly patient and knows what he's doing!   We started off with the Drunken Cheesy Bread it's ok. Not something I would want again. Nothing wrong with it just not my taste.   For lunch I had the Chicken Parmesan sandwich along with a house salad. The sandwich is great. Loved it.  The house salad... I mean I could not stop eating it. I have no idea which kind of dressing was on it but it was AMAZING. I am craving it just thinking about it.   The interior is very clean roomy very casual. I heard they have great happy hour so I will be back again.
neg	I decided to break from routine and get a haircut at a local Great Clips. I called ahead and asked if they had an experienced barber that could do a flat top. The lady assured me that they did. I was Leary to say the least when she sat me in a chair of a 20 something fibbertygibbet dressed like Madonna. Half way through this butchering she asked my advice and then the advice of the owner on how to accomplish this haircut. Kid you not it was an inch longer at the sides than the center. I looked like a cross between the Gunny and flock of seagulls. I went home set the clippers on 3 and finished the job......Would not go back here unless I lost a bet.
pos	I was in Bomberos for breakfast this morning and I was told they now carry Coca Lite!  So much better than Diet Coke - I had no idea I could find it anywhere in the US!  How great is that?  Also Bomberos is now using MJ Breads and Tammie Co pastries... not too shabby huh?
neg	we visited on april 15th and And also Sunday April 22.. I have twice now gone to your restaurant and twice been told that I couldnt use my BOGO coupon. The first time my mother went to pick up our order she was told we didnt order the right food and we had to order off the main entress. The second time we ordered I was told that we had to order off of the DINER SELECT menu. I did not have my coupon handy and when I was able to read it it says specifically \"Offer valid for one complimentary Diner Select with the purchase of another entree. Complimentary Diner Select must be of equal or lesser value to purchase entree. Valid entrees include SIGNATURE DISHES BOWLS SALADS DINER SELECTS AND LETTUCE WRAPS.\" So why on two separate occasions were we told conflicting information and not allowed to use the coupon thus spending a small fortune on food TWICE?!?!? Your customer service is far from what it used to be and I doubt you will be getting more of our business any time in the near future.
pos	I recently saw a Coyotes game here and I was seriously impressed. This arena is super nice almost mall-like and clean on the inside. What also impressed me was how much stuff there is around the arena. Where I'm from you'd have to drive somewhere else if you want to go to dinner before or hang out after the game. Here you can just stay in your cozy little free parking spot and hang around. Probably my only gripe is that the screens on the inside could be a little bigger but other than that. this arena is right up there.
neg	The parking is my beef with this place.  Why does a customer have to pay $12 for each time we park at the garage?  If you move in and out three times that's $36 for parking.  Yes my company was paying but this was just outright stupid and I wouldn't make my company pay for this again. I've been to Phoenix twice since then and I've avoided this place and stayed at the Marriot.  Much better place.
pos	What a place for brunch. $4 drinks are fantastic. Their tenderloin egg Benedict and sea food sandwich is heavenly. Wish we had such a place in Los Angeles.
neg	The owner has changed hands & this place isn't what it used to be.  If you want up to date paper & quality product...go to Scrap Happy OR Crop Girls!
pos	Fast service. Great burgers and fries. So far the Arizona burger coupled with sweet potato fries is my favorite.
neg	Wish I could review this place on service but I wasn't able to get one.  Walked in at 1 PM on a Sunday afternoon for a mani pedi was told by the front nail tech to have a seat.  I get it I walked in on a Sunday afternoon so they are going to be busy and I am fine to wait.  My wait turned into 30 minutes and no one said a word to me.  Then the front nail guy tells me it is going to be another 20 minutes before someone would be able to get to me.  You know your salon you know your techs and how long it will take them to do a service as well as how many people are in front of me so it would have been nice to have gotten a expected wait time before I wasted an hour my time.  I ended up leaving and going to another salon who saw me right away    The place in general was dirty nail polish spilled down the wall and dust everywhere.  I did not get to see how clean their pedi baths and chairs were but the front waiting and front desk area was filthy.
pos	Island Terrayki is a great place to eat at.  The owners are nice the prices are right you can't go wrong with that.  My coworkers and I have been going there for a few years now and we all love it.  Highly suggest eating here if you are in the northwest valley and want some good quality food.
neg	OH MAHHH GOSH what retards they have working here. Came in to pay for my phone bill and literally stood in line for 40 effing minutes. They had TWO ppl out on the sales floor that afternoon and the store was freaking packed. Really? What genius decided to schedule TWO freaking meat-heads who knew diddly squat about anything on a busy Saturday afternoon??? And no I don't care to upgrade my phone. I JUST WANT TO PAY FOR MY BILL AND GTFO OF THERE!!!! Do you really think that after such poor service I am going to want to up your commission rate by purchasing/upgrading my phone with you? NO.
pos	Whitney walked into Renegade Canteen and never had a chance. Nor did any of her previous favorite Scottsdale spots.   The green chile pork stew is enough to make a good date great or a bad date totally tolerable. Tender juicy sent from above...having this dish once is not enough. You won't have the heart to inform your mother that after tasting McGrath's bowl of deliciousness any pork dish she's ever prepared seems dry and flavorless.   We can only hope that the clouds in heaven are made of the mashed potatoes. I get them every time. The filet was the best steak I've ever had (I've thought about it trust me) and the Dr. Pepper braised short rib will give you something else to think about the next time the Kiss \"Dr. Love\" commercial comes on.   yummmmmmers.
neg	I hate for my first official review to be a one star review but Macayo's really disappointed me last night. When I first pulled into the parking lot last night I was surprised to see how many empty parking spaces there were. I immediately got excited because normally any restaurant on Bell road any night of the week has a wait. However when I walked inside I saw a slew of people waiting to be seated. I walked up to the hostess stand and put my name on the list and the hostess did not give me a time quote and when I asked how long it would be she quoted me \"not too long.\" We waited about 15 minutes before being shown to our table which is where the trouble really began.   Once we were at our table we were quickly greeted by our server (yay) however she told us she had another table's drink order to get and then she would be back for ours (boo). So we waited for her to take the other two tables drink orders before coming back to take ours.   After about 10 minutes we got our fountain drinks and then 5 minutes later she came back to take our food order. Then it took about 50 minutes for our food to come out. Seriously 50 minutes.... that's about how long I planned to spend at Macayo's not how long I planned on waiting for my appetizer of taquitos to take to come out. And to top it off we were missing a side of rice and a side of baja sauce. We decided not to mention it as we did not want to wait another hour for the two items to come out. So after eating and waiting for our drinks to be refilled 3 times we finally got the check to which the server apologized for our wait. Apparently she couldn't have apologized at all during our 50 minute minute wait she needed to wait until tip time.   I don't recommend going to Macayos. You might have better luck at any of the other 10 Mexican restaurants on Bell Road.
pos	This is a Mom & Pop Mexican restaurant on Tempe's east end the food is awesome and of the good \"Homemade\" quality. Known the family for almost 30 yrs now.
neg	If I could give zero stars I would. Just about the worst experience for my friend and I. We came in for a quick and easy dinner.  After being ignored at the door way repeatedly we sat ourselves.  First we had a girl server who said shed be back with menus but right in front of us at the bar we see her flirting instead of coming back. Our server switched to another guy who was just as bad at serving. I have no idea how this place ever received more than one star based on the staff alone. They're lazy slow and completely ruin the entire experience of dining there.  The happy hour prices are great but there are other RA's so do yourself a favor and go to a different location.
pos	ABSOLUTELY ADORE THIS RESTAURANT!!!! Amazing location and such a great food !!! Been going there for a long long time! I have yet be even slightly annoyed. BLISS! They wait on you hand and foot food presentation and TASTE is Fantastic...Always make you feel very special.. the hostesses are not rude nor snooty and are always smiling- GREAT Managers! LOVE them all around! ( and I AM SUPER PICKY ( and Proud of it!) DO IT!!! GO THERE!!!!! #1 rest. per me in AZ for beautiful location and food!
neg	Im going to have to agree Whole heartedly. And i informed the manager of it as well. I picked this one because it was close to the Airport and the Light Rail. The noise from the Airport wasnt to bad. But it was the Train Horns all NIGHT LONG and ALL MORNING when your trying to sleep. I wouldnt pick this one the neighborhood wasnt bad despite what people say. But the Train noise is just unbearable. I got it for the Click 6 rate which was reasonable. Stay Elsewhere. I should of picked one further down that was right off the light rail.
pos	Had a family style meal and everything was delicious.  Rigatoni in a cream sauce with chicken was outstanding as was the pound cake dessert.  Appetizer stuffed mushrooms were also really good.  On the pricey side but nice for a special occasion.
neg	I should have taken my own advice and stayed far away from this place. Our most recent visit ended hastily when I was served rotten tuna and got barely a \"sorry\" from the staff. I could smell that the fish had gone horribly horribly off when the ahi tuna salad was put before me by the waiter and I'm shocked that the kitchen actually thought they'd get away with sending it out. The waiter disappeared so quickly from my table that I had to go hunt him down to point out the bad smell at my table was coming from the food and he took my plate back to the kitchen and five minutes later came back to say \"okay we all smelled it and there's definitely something wrong there.\"  Seriously? You had to go pass it around to confirm that I'm not crazy when you can clearly tell within ten seconds that this is not how raw fish should smell? After all this their solution was to comp an appetizer not the salad and eventually gave me a new salad to go which I decided not to eat just to be on the safe side.   Look I'm not scared to eat week old leftovers or sushi at a divey joint and I don't really get freaked out by the cleanliness of restaurants but this could have been dangerous.  I have absolutely warned off all my coworkers and friends against this place and now I'm warning all of Yelp. It could have been handled in a way that left me confident that it was just another new restaurant kink but the awful service made it clear that's not the case and I shudder to think of what new low they'll sink to.
pos	Simply an AWESOME tuna sandwich! Great service and the atmosphere was really cool. Just wondering what the difference is between pickles and cucumbers in brine. (50 cents apparently)
neg	I was really disgusted with this place. I should have known when we walked in on Saturday at 12:30 PM and there was no one (not exagerating)  there.  But we were hungry and hot so we stayed. I wanted shrimp tacos but no shrimp at tacos del MAR...just frozen fish that you need to order 5 minutes ahead because they need to microwave it.   It's breaded and precut...couldn't they at least get the kind that has different shapes and looked like it wasn't completely processed?  The kids had bean burritos which they usually love anywhere but didn't like at all. My husband's chicken burrito tasted like a school cafeteria.  The clincher was that the unsweetened ice tea tasted rancid.  I think they let the tea bags go bad or something.  Gross and how annoying that they  don't have seafood.  Wahoo tacos from La Jolla please come here to AZ!!!
pos	Recently was invited to this restaurant & found out that they have children's plates for adults or any age.  It was SUPER CHEAP & it included a drink with refills like tea or soda etc.  What a deal!  Under 5. bucks including the drink.  I will definitely  be going back  to any Cracker Barrel who has this deal because it is cheaper than fast food etc. or just about anywhere.
neg	Wow. I'm not even going to wait until I'm done before leaving a review. I just placed my order 30 minutes after sitting down.  11:35 - Sit at a table for 8 an order drinks. So far so good.  11:39 - Things were going alright when we had a table of 8 but when a few more people showed up to attempt to give Floridino's some money in return for a quick lunch all hell broke loose.  11:41 - There was a room next to us with a bunch of empty tables. \"You can't sit in there. We don't have a server in there.\" Screw it we picked up our drinks and moved in. If they can serve us at that table they can serve us one table over in this other room.  11:45 - We asked to see the manager.  11:50 - \"We can get you drinks in here but not food. We have to wait for a table to open up out there. Then we can serve you.\"  11:52 - Someone who looks like a manager peeks into the room and leaves. We still haven't spoken to a manager...  11:55 - \"We don't want to overwhelm the kitchen.\" (Hmm.. If you didn't want to \"overwhelm\" the kitchen maybe you should have taken my order 20+ minutes ago...)  12:05 - They're taking our food orders in the Forbidden Room. I guess they're not as allergic to accepting our money as they led us to believe.  12:32 - Just received my food in the Forbidden Room. Pretty much exactly an hour after I got here.  You suck Floridino's.
pos	Oregano's is my FAVORITE restaurant in all of Tempe! The food is delicious - I've never been disappointed by a single appetizer entrée or desert! And since they've recently add Blue Moon beer on draft I could stay here on the patio all day. Bonus: The wait staff is incredibly fun and friendly. Just a really great place to dine!
neg	Went to Sol for restaurant week.  Was less than impressed with the bitter salad with MIA avocados the carnitas that were very bland and boring the rice was delicious however the black beans tasted like aspirin dessert was a dulche flan that was hard solid and icky.  Service was average took 2 hours to get thru dinner.  Best part was the refreshing wine and beer!  Cheers to SOL we wont be returning.
pos	I love this place. Every time I visit I come here. I did miss out of Bucket of Crab night :(
neg	I would not recommend this place to anyone.  I went there looking for a gift.  I received no help.  The girl was too busy helping the wives of the baseball players.  I guess you need a large bank account to receive help in this store. Also they did not have a very good selection of items. I think I will take my business to other stores who care about their customers.
pos	Talk about one of the best burgers in town...in fact i think houstons and this place have the best burgers in phoenix!!!! I took one bite and i was in heaven...it was a whole new take on a burger but not too crazy!! I love the fries especially when you mix the sweet potato fries with the regular ones OMG!!!  I like to dip them in ranch but you can select what you want to.dip them in...i have to thank.my sister for this place she introduced me!!! Its a great place to.go for lunch and dinner but it.is not very big so you may have to wait but its worth it!!! Its a fun place do not miss it...
neg	I was searching for a unique item to give as a Thank You gift and I stopped by Practical Art over the Labor Day weekend after viewing some items on their website.  I was extremely under underwhelmed by the service I received and do not plan on returning.    When I arrived the young woman behind the counter was having a personal conversation with an acquaintance.  Besides the employee and her conversation buddy the store was empty.  I spent about ten minutes looking around and the young woman did not have the common courtesy to acknowledge me with a simple \"Hello\" even as I was viewing items directly in front of the counter.  When I was leaving the store she did break long enough to say \"Bye\".  I believe it is very important to support local business but I will not spend my money here.  I did find several items I wanted to buy and made note of the artist. I have done the extra leg work to reach out to them to find out how to purchase their items through other channels.  I do not feel they should miss a sale due to the sub par customer service at this location.
pos	Dr Brodkin is one of the greatest doctor out there.  She was voted two years in a row for arizona foothill top doctor and it shows!!!  She is caring and overall great doctor.  She moved her office last year and wow did she change for the best.  The staff is great her new nurses i love love love....i recommend Dr Brodkin to anyone who need  a GYN....
neg	Went into the location and waited minutes for someone to appear to ask us for our order and even after we said Hello they didn't acknowledge us. Had to repeat order several times. It was very frustrating how nothing seemed to be in stock no philly cheese steak nor soup was available. I heard someone as I was leaving being told some type of bread wasn't available (which is actually understandable condiments and bread sometimes run out or need to be retrieved/baked).   Felt like we were being rushed and just didn't feel like a clean place. Will not go back.
pos	After shopping all over town and visiting every single shop in the phx area I stumbled into this little gem.   Store was clean and only stocked with desirable items and lacked the items that just arent used by the majority but I am sure could be ordered if needed.    This planning I found easy to make my purchases in a quicker manner since I dont always have the time to sort through typical store junk there just isnt any here! Only quality sought after items.  Management is second to none and the business is family owned and operated.   When you walk in your greeted and after a few visits by name even.  This is a huge plus and isnt found anywhere else in town that I have seen.   There is a prefered customer program and most livestock is local grown and special items are taken in a wish list and you can get called once available.    After my month long search for the perfect store to set up my custom order that could also fulfill my stocking needs I couldnt get my order in fast enough for a complete custom setup installed and delivered.   Pricing was fantastic and cheaper than anywhere in town and the ability to come in anytime and get advice no matter what the need is makes this shop feel like home when you walk in.   If your looking for a one stop shop that is friendly knowledgeable and isnt out to empty your wallet in a bad way this is your place.   Thanks again Reef Monsters for the help in sorting out what was an overwhelming amount of information into a custom tailoring to what I could handle and needed to continue in this hobby.
neg	If only I where rating this place based on their sushi I would give it 5 stars.  But I'm not  rating it based on the food.  It is purely based on the customer service in this establishment.  Be warned; if you have a large party this is NOT the place to go.  I've been in the restaurant industry for over 20 years and I have NEVER heard of a restaurant not splitting checks for large parties.  So for an over 500.00 bill they will take 15+ different forms of payment but won't split up the check by individuals or couples.  How does this make any sense.  To make matters worse; they bring out the sushi and I quote \"family style\".  Since when did sushi get served family style?  Here is the problem.  Sushi is expensive not everyone at the table ate it and when served \"family style\" someone else may get what you ordered and you won't have a clue it even made it to the table.  We spent over 40 minutes trying to figure out this bill SERIOUSLY!  When I asked the manager her generic and obviously well rehearsed response was \"this is our company policy we do not split checks for large parties\".  This is absurd.  So not only did we have a heck of a time figuring out the bill I'm pretty sure no one really knew who had what and if they had added random things to the bill.  How could you know with that many people ordering????  I never received part of what I ordered yet it made it on that bill.  So here we have to pay it regardless of what we may or may not have received?  I understand that adding gratuity to a party this size is also common practice which I don't normally have a problem with but how about some EXCELLENT customer service in return.  If policy is no separate checks at least tell everyone as they order or as a group that this will occur.  They said someone was told when the reservation was made.  The reservation was made for 25 people!  It would've taken 2 seconds to again relay this important piece of information.  Worst experience ever!
pos	I absolutely love Chompies! It's the closest thing to a New York style deli that I have found in Phoenix. They have a very large and extensive menu and everything I've ordered has been really good.  They also have an amazing bakery that offers a very large assortment of tasty treats such as black and white cookies red velvet cake enormous éclairs napoleons and New York style cheese cake.  I'd say that my favorite thing on the menu is the pastrami sandwich although I recently tried the Jewish Sliders after seeing them on Man vs. Food. The sliders were really good unlike any slider I have ever had. The challah bread and potato pancake gave these sliders a very unique flavor very tasty. I also tried the Western Sliders and those are good as well.   Although I live closer to their new location in Chandler I still go to the Tempe location because of the hot ASU waitresses.  Chompies is the best!
neg	Quick spot for a mall-made mayo-based California roll. This is where you go to learn how sushi can go wrong.  You've been hard at work doing swipe-and-sign. Perhaps you even dropped a thousand bucks at Neiman's on a worthless Jhane Barnes' sweater and some silk-lined Zanella slacks or three thousand on a whats-left-of-last-season's-collection of Brioni blazer. Whatever your fancy you're toting a wrist full of roped glossy shooshing-sounding bags with tissue paper sticking out the tops. You just want a break and some cool refreshing sushi.  It's OK but beware. Unagi and other \"hot\" items have a \"beep-beep beep-beep\" before they get to you. California and spicy tuna rolls come real quick -- 'cause they come from a vat of mayonnaise. Rice is not right either. Stick to tuna and salmon sashimi and miso soup.  If head chef Rick is there (think Kyoto of Empire at 24th and Camelback then Ichi Ban University off McClintock) ask him to make you a Fat Bob on Acid for good ol' times' sake. Or just go to Starbucks tide yourself over and find a real sushi restaurant.  And about the Brioni... Don't sweat the buyer's remorse. It'll make a great tax deduction to Florence's.
pos	This is  the best Asian restaurant in town! Previously Shanghai Palace this out of the way restaurant serves up some of the best curry and pad Thai that I have ever tasted in my life! The Panang Curry is so savory and aromatic literally one of the best things I have ever had. I honestly crave this dish about twice a week. Also any thing on the menu can be made vegetarian this is a huge bonus for all veggie's around town!  The Chef-owner Tottie Kaya is always very hospitable. She walks around to each table making sure everything is up to standard. I have never once had a bad experience at this delicious eatery. So if you love Asian cuisine you must dine at Tottie's!
neg	I usually do not complain about bad food but the fish and chips gave my wife a serious case of food poisoning.  So if some manager reads this please check out your fish supply or change the cooking oil.  She never gets sick and has been sick all day (December 29 2012) from the meal eaten December 28 2012.
pos	Best pizza I've had anywhere.  Perfect perfect and I mean perfect crust.  Thin chewy smoky and sweet.  Lots of interesting toppings that center around fresh local produce.  I deeply envy the regulars here.
neg	My son and his family arrived into Scottsdale Tuesday April 10 on there way to California. We decided to eat at RnR before they continued there trip.  My son and my wife ordered a hamburger and fries. The fries had no taste and my son asked for two new orders. My grandchildren ate the original fries while the new fries loaded with Parmesan cheese. The fries were not hot nor had the cheese melted. I had a few of the fries and did not have as severe a case of food poisoning as my son and my wife.   I have recommended RnR in the past. I do not think I will in the future.
pos	I have been going to the Matador since I was little when it was a little hole in the wall on 2nd Street.  They have always had great Sonoran style Mexican food!  It's always our go to place when we attend events downtown or have business to attend to. They also have the best hot sauce in town!  As far as the service  the food comes out quickly and we never really have to wait long.  If you're downtown and looking for great food I would highly recommend this place.
neg	My wife and I have going to this restaurant on Thursday night for past three months to have a beer and a slice.  A couple weeks ago I went there for the usual but there was an NFL game and a World series game on and the restaurant was busy.  I put my name in and waited for my wife and the table.  30 minutes went by and wife had not shown up and the table had just become available.  Hostess said I can't seat you unless your other party shows up first.  I called my wife she cancelled.  Hostess would not seat me as a single...TERRIBLE..Hostess did not tell me this when I first put my name in.  WON'T BE GOING TO ANY OF THE ZIPPS EVER AGAIN.
pos	What an awesome neighborhood bar. I brought my little brother here when he was in town and the service was spectacular. For entertainment they have pool darts games and music. Our waitress Chris was more than attentive. I will defiantly be coming back!
neg	I was excited to go to the lululemon athletica at Scottsdale Quarter because I really enjoyed shopping at the previous store that closed in Scottsdale. Well something has changed... I walked into the store and while there were more sales clerks than customers no one said a word to me and no one asked if I needed any help. They were all too busy talking with one another. And to add insult to to injury... one clerk had to walk around me (didn't ask if I needed help) and went to play with one of the customers dogs.... I had fully intended to buy a Christmas gift there but left because the service was so poor and I did need help with the sizing.   I went over to the Nike store and had a totally different experience very positive.  I'll stick with Lucy and Nike where they appreciate their customers.
pos	unless you hate ice cream and friendly people you will love Papa Ed's! It's tucked away in Caitlin Court in downtown Glendale.  Walking towards the front you can't help but notice all the love and care that went into the garden and flowers - the flower bed still makes me smile!  Walking through the front door it's easy to forget where and when you are - the wood floors Vintage coke machine and friendly staff all most made me forget why I was there... ICE CREAM. good selection and great ice cream..   Now let's talk about ice cream pie... Papa Ed's makes to order (with advance notice) ice cream pies. I love the Peanut butter cup with Oreo cookie crust. The lemon and Raspberry sorbet swirl in a  graham cracker crust and my Holiday Favorite - Pumpkin Pie Ice Cream in a graham cracker crust!
neg	It saddens me to say that this isn't the worst Mexican restaurant we've eaten at that's on Oahu near Waikiki beach but it's close.    Damn it we had to drive by Arriba's to get to this place.     I had a chimichanga that was a little anemic though what there was of the filling was ok  beans  tasteless rice looked the part but as spicy as your average UK meal involving boiled meat and root vegetables.   Erin's Fajita salad was similarly lack luster  with  all the appearance of being tasty yet   bland chicken. Usually unless there's an attempt at \"chefing\" as opposed to cooking  I'll order a basic dish ( I don't shoot the chef though  and trust me these guys are safe from Agent Sands  very safe)  for the first time out  and if the beans/rice suck.. no return.  Overall It feels like aliens space ones are running the place and they learned cooking from pictures.  It's certainly a mistake we won't be repeating.
pos	I have been shopping at Lee Lee's for over ten years.  The store stocks Chinese Malaysian Korean Japanese West Indian and other foods.  You can usually find what you are looking for here.    The fish selection is vast fresh and reasonably priced.    They have the finest selection of noodles and yerba mate tea!!!  Enjoy
neg	La Grande Orange Grocery has a problem. It can't decide what it wants to be when it grows up and that makes the overall experience iffy. Is it a quick mart? A grocery store? A restaurant? A coffee shop? Unfortunately it can't be all of them.  I love La Grande Orange Pizzeria when there is table service fun wait-staff and delicious food. But during the day on the weekends the Grocery is too busy and unorganized to tolerate. It is not set up for the crowd they do a poor job of line management and when there is a line to order the rest of the Grocery is impossible to navigate. To top it off the counter staff shouts at you when your food is ready. Unnecessary.  I'll certainly be back at night for the pizza the delicious wings and to partake of the best gelato shop adjacent to LGO. But I'm afraid that I won't be back for the weekend chaos.
pos	Y'know rarely do I buy the \"extended warranty\" that most places try to peddle on you nowadays. If you buy the item from a reputable manufacturer it should be unnecessary.   In the case of tires I have to make an exception.   You can control the quality of tires you buy and put on your car but not the quality of construction workers who don't know how to secure their nails screws and bolts for travel on highways streets and other local thoroughfares. They're a nefarious bunch for the most part. I'm not for extra taxes but I'm contacting my local elected officials to institute a tax on all businesses who transport these little metal devils on the streets we drive...and stiff penalties/massive fines if they get caught dropping a load of these on the highway.   For the second time in a year one of my tires caught one of the little buggers -- this last one was not a nail or screw mind you but a BOLT.  I pulled my receipts from the glove compartment used Yelp to find the nearest Discount Tire and called for a tow.   The replacement certificates I got were $16 per tire (back in NC but they're good here too) and worth every penny. The folks at this Discount Tire location were extremely nice and had me in and out of there in about 30 minutes (with no appointment). There is even free water for customers. They were able to fix the tire instead of replacing it which is fine (as long as it holds).   Every Discount Tire location I've visited has been great as far as the transparency of what you're getting the quality of customer service and the wait. In a town of 4.3 million people and never-ending road construction I have to recommend the free replacement warranty on your tires no matter where you buy them. I prefer getting mine from DT.
neg	I found Gaylee to be the most unprofessional nail tech.  I found her on an internet deal.  I called her on Sat and requested an apt on the following Friday.  She never returned my call till I reported her.  She denied my 5 messages and said she only got one msg which she couldn't return cause she lost her voice.  She conveniently had a voice after she was investigated.  I would never trust her to do my nails.  Yet reading the reviews she did return some calls.
pos	Best whole in the wall Chinese food in the west valley! I have been going here as a kid and I would go there again and again. Take out is great and I would recommend getting take out there. Now eating there I might not suggest taking the food home is awesome!
neg	Tonight at Noca Phoenix No dinner -waited 1.5 hours with no communication only to be told they were out of the fish I ordered left the restaurant 2 hrs later very hungry   Very  disappointing
pos	Beautiful hotel great rooms best views out of the resorts in the immediate area.  Service is comparable to a Ritz Carlton.  Very understated and clean feeling yet still over the top luxurious.
neg	Won't be going there again. Our chicken was pink! Manager was a prick in regards to that and service was all around crappy.
pos	I'm in (puppy) love with the new Wag N'Wash in Scottsdale...  I'd been to the Phoenix location years ago and remember wishing they were closer to my home and my wish was granted... this new location is less than a mile from where I live!  Minnie and I popped in a few weeks back for a self-serve bath.  I initially called to see if a groomer was in but they were booked out for weeks.  Doing it myself was actually not only cheaper but it was fun... and a good bonding experience for me and Min as well.  Sara helped us out and explained our options.  We decided on the ultimate wash which included an extremely efficient shampoo and conditioner brushes towels cologne etc... It was easy and quick - bonus! Minnie was clean and fresh within 20 minutes or so!  Of course we spent a tad bit more time at the store doing some shopping and I was impressed with the dog food selection homemade treats eco-friendly collars and leashes etc...  I'll definitely head back to Wag N' Wash again really soon... so psyched that they moved to my 'hood!
neg	Having a miserable experience flying from Boston to Reno. My connection was in Phoenix and the flight from Boston was running a bit late. I asked both of the flight attendants if it would be possible to deplane before the other passengers as I had a very tight connection to make. One actually laughed at me and told me I would be fine. 12 hours a horrible nights sleep (as they did not offer me hotel accommodations) and two delicious airport meals later I am sitting in the terminal waiting for my flight from Phoenix to Reno to board. Sorry buddy not really fine. I missed my flight by 5 minutes. I would have been fine if US Airways offered their customers with tight connections the opportunity to deplane first as every other airline I have flown on does. Will avoid them at ALL costs!
pos	Great food great Sangria great live music great vibe great service EXCLAMATION MARK. Overall it was a great way to spend a Sunday afternoon.
neg	Went for lunch. Took over 30 min for food to arrive. Ordered chef salad. Made with processed turkey and ham. Also with processed cheese slices. childs choc milk was not mixed up. Kraft mac & cheese on kids menu.  Won't come back again.
pos	Amazing. Romantic!
neg	The food is simple pure and uncomplicated; you taste (and hopefully enjoy) each ingredient. However as with most minimally processed cooked foods it does not travel well.  So eat in. Luckily the decor is modern and compliments the menu well which makes eating in a pleasure.     My only down note is on the service. If you are not careful when you enter the restaurant you may enter through the door of invisibility and will become invisible to the employees. As a result you may stand at the counter while they work around you but do not recognize your presence until the invisibility dust (or whatever makes you invisible) wears off.  Based upon my late lunch experience today the dust takes 4 iPhone e-mail responses or texts to be removed (10ish minutes). Regrettably I only had three unanswered e-mails in my inbox and had to leave before I could be seen by the employees. On a positive note when you leave (regardless of the time you waited) the invisibility dust seems to be removed. I know this as no one honked or screamed at my car as it drove away without a driver.
pos	Absolute greatness!!!  Service: friendly  Food: TRY the faux chicken wings (I crave this) Kung pao noodles Vegan chilli fries  Ambiance - A+  Tip: don't order the faux chicken wings Togo. Soggy experience plus they add the carrots cucumber celery in the box and close it. Equals the case of raw cooked veggies.   Go next door to nami for dessert!!
neg	For frozen yogurt quality I give this place a one. Honestly it's small there's very little variety in terms of toppings and the yogurt tastes cheap... Probably because it's a big franchise. There is a reason why you're paying less for an ounce... Truly - you get what you pay for.  The concept is neat sure but if you're looking for pizzazz then you should try Yogurtini... It's just up the road from Yogurtland. Anyway the single star says it all... \"Eek! Methinks not.\"
pos	Tried the Restaurant Week special and chose the Stetson chopped salad mixed mushrooms with polenta and bread pudding.  The Stetson chopped was amazing.  The preparation is beautiful when they bring it out and then the taste is the perfect mix of sweet savory crunchy soft once the salad is mixed up.  I tried some of the testosterone salad which was decent and filled with a lot of well prepared beef but it didn't quite compare to the chopped salad.    Just as a general side note if you choose the restaurant week menu and have the chopped salad and then the mushrooms I think the flavor of the chopped salad is more bold than the mushrooms so the mushrooms will taste bland to you.  This happened to me as I transitioned from the salad to main dish but when I took the mushrooms home in a to go box and ate them later the more delicate flavor showed through and I appreciated it a lot more.    The bread pudding was amazing.  Perfectly moist with lots of flavor and not too sweet.    Service was excellent (Thanks Owen!) and along with the extensive selection of wines they also have some more unique beers such as lambic as well as a nice selection of non alcoholic sodas (The cream soda is locally made and very tasty!)
neg	\"Fake\" (or rather condescending) service from the \"Service Manager\"...and he didn't even acknowledge me when I asked the status of my car (uh more like IGNORE). Ended every sentence with an impolite \"No ma'am\" or \"Yes ma'am\"... ya get the scenario. Basically the guy was a real JERK.  They couldn't even figure out HOW to fix my car even when I TOLD them what was wrong with it ( had been diagnosed at the Dealership). Two guys were sitting there staring at the computer (as if it was going to magically speak to them). At least they didn't charge me but what a waste of time waiting for 90 minutes....
pos	Being English and missing a lot of the things we can't get over here we were delighted to have found this place.  I have not tried all of the pasties and have stuck to the traditional ones that we get at home i.e cheese and onion and cornish and they are very good!!  I sent my husband there to buy their half baked ones so we could freeze them and have whenever we get the craving and I ended up ordering $80 worth without any regrets.  Needless to say my freezer is full of pasties and I even have a couple of ones I have not tasted before so looking forward to trying those.  Have not eaten in the place either but quite frankly the food is that good I don't it would matter what it's like inside.  Also just noticed this is the Mesa shop we have only bought from the newly opened on in Tempe.
neg	I came here at noon during spring break. When I walked in no one was there. I rang the bell on the counter. No one came out from the back. I waited and rang the bell again. Nobody. I waited and rang the bell a third time. No one. I walked out having been unable to even find an employee much less place an order and try the food. Pathetic.
pos	Even though the new place is limited on seating the food more than makes up the difference.    I took my wife and kids for lunch.  We had some pulled pork and beef brisket sandwiches fresh made slaw and mac and cheese made from scratch like mom used to make.  The kids gobbled up the mac and cheese.  The meat was definately cooked with love.    Grady's makes their own signature sauce in several varieties.  They sell bottles of it as well.  I liked mixing the Hot with the Super Hot to make that pork melt that much better in my mouth.  I also noticed they do catering.  I've had events catered by some other BBQ joints before but this food is much better quality and I think I can woo the crowds with Grady's BBQ.  I fully recommend stopping into my new favorite barbeque place in Arizona.  Thanks for making good food Grady.  We all enjoyed it and writing this made me hungry for more.
neg	what can I say about Glam... well i really really despise it. Every time I go there I regret the decision. And in my grandiose style I'm going to say why in a list:  1) Cash only!! But listen to this the bartender will take your debit card charge you a fee and give you cash which you can then use to buy drinks from the same bartender that just did the whole transaction. WHY????   2) The location kinda blows. It's in a weird strip mall across from another strip mall. Have you ever driven by there in the day time? It's shady then imagine at night time.  3) too hipster. I feel like I am not allowed there as I work for the man do not wear black leggings or have razor cut bangs. I in my mall clothing and \"mainstream\" style stick out like a sore thumb.  4) The music is just a little off.... ii dunno how to say what I am thinking it's just off.  Okay the floor is fancy. That's about it.  (sorry I'm a bar snob and Glam deserves my wrath)
pos	I love love love the chicken & hummus appetizer. Its served w/ sauteed spinach and pita. Although its an app its large enough for a light meal. Most times I get that w/ the beet salad and split it w/ a friend. Perfect.   For those of you who avoid beets I think you'll change your mind w/ this salad. The beets are sweet like candy.  Served w/ feta mandarin oranges candied pecans and a very unique pear dressing you forget you're eating healthy. I've been trying to harvest the pear vinaigrette recipe forever!!! They won't give up the secret sauce! :(   Enjoy!
neg	Very loud crowded and quite unpleasant. I felt very cramped and the environment was very uncomfortable.
pos	I have shared many an awful hungover morning with my favorite stars from the Gay Corridor. The service can be on the scary tweaker side but it's a good simple breakfast that doesn't stress my dehydrated mind to find deliciousness. They've also many different healthy options not that I've ever done more than glance at those but it's wonderful nonetheless. It's the crown and glory of Park Central and the only reason I still consider Park Central an actual place as opposed to the reality of it just being a bad idea.
neg	I enjoy falafels and my boyfriend really likes Gyros.  So when we received a coupon for Daphne's Greek Café we were jazzed to go check it out.  What I noticed right away is it has kind of a fast-food sort of feel to it and I thought OK its catering to people on their lunch breaks.  However the food itself is like Greek fast food for people who have never had anywhere near really Greek food before and so they wouldn't know any better.  The plates are astatically pleasing with everything arranged nice and neat.  This amounted to zilch to me.  When I got to eat I want plenty of food and I want quality as appropriately expected from the type of establishment I am eating at.    At Daphne's you get a few little thin slices of what may or may not be real gyro meat.  The falafel meat is little over fried disks.  That's right disks.  Not balls of falafel meat where the outside is slightly crunchy and the inside is meaty and moist.  The pita bread is not.  It's just some flat bread cut into little triangles.  The tzatziki sauce is ... what the heck is this stuff in this little 1 inch paper cup?  The vegetables were fresh.  There is more to complain about with this place but you get the picture.  I'm thinking that anyone who likes it here just doesn't know what real Greek food is like.
pos	...the customer service alone gets 5 stars but when you factor in the semi-annual sales it is more like 6.  Having been to a number of Nordstrom's in multiple cities I'd put this particular location on the same level as those in San Francisco (without the assinine traffic to contend with) and Seattle and only a notch below the best of the best in Chicago.    Living in a city with a Nordstrom and a Nordstrom Rack is going to be a daily exercise in resisting temptation.
neg	I don't intend to return but based on the way we were treated by the kitchen earlier this week my \"uncouth\" self doesn't exactly feel welcome anyway. However I'm not quite convinced that it's my loss...   It had been almost a year since my original visit to Breadfruit which did not overwhelm (as you can judge by it taking me a year to make it back) but I did have an appreciation of the option for Caribbean cuisine.   Since a friend and I were going to be downtown for an event I suggested Breadfruit for our dinner spot. We enjoy good food and supporting local. The option to pick up wine at the Public Market next door and have the already reasonable corkage fee waived was a bonus as we had really enjoyed a couple of the Arizona Stronghold wines at a recent FnB wine pairing and thought they would pair well with the Jamaican heat!   While the scallops were delicious and cooked perfectly 2 for $12.50 -- $6.25 per scallop -- is a tad steep in my book. We also shared the Jerk Chicken Salad ($9.95) and the Jerk Prawns Off the Grill ($14.95).   Here's the ultimate rub the bottom of the menu states \"no substitutions or modifications\"... Since when is cutting a KFC-side-sized ear of corn a \"modification\"?   At the same time the menu describes the restaurant and it's offerings as \"Nothing fancy; simply good food that nourishes and rejuvenates the body.\"   It seems like cutting something in half so we could easily share it -- particularly after the plate has been delivered to the table for us to appreciate it's \"beauty\" AND after we've communicated to our server and demonstrated with the first two courses that we were splitting the items -- is in the vein of \"nothing fancy.\"   How about providing the customer with an appropriate utensil to cut it themselves then?   The fact that the chef was obstinate in refusing to cut the KFC-side-sized ear of corn provided with our entree screams \"pretentious and grandiose\" and tainted our entire experience.   To quote my dinning companion \"You are not James Beard and James Beard would've cut the corn!\"
pos	I am a huge fan of Saigon Nites. A friend and I regularly eat here (once weekly) and we have NEVER had a bad experience. The Steak Pho is amazing. Typically when I Have Pho I load it up with hot sauces chili oil etc...not at Saigon! Their Pho is ready to rock and roll the second it leaves the kitchen. Two thumbs way up!
neg	My boyfriend and I tried this place last year and we haven't been back since. The food was really unspectacular they weren't really that hot. The price is a bit high since there's a restaurant by the same name on Southern and Dobson that serve much better food for less. The decor was really tacky and they should paint over the mural it does not appeal to their clientele. Lastly the staff was not nice.
pos	Food is good to the tummy. To me this is better than in and out burger. Place is spotless  friendly service and wide selection.
neg	The salad plates were not chilled... As they usually are it however is a busy night but something's are expected at the olive garden... The food tasted like it was under a hot lamp for so long it tasted almost hard and also under cooked for the seafood... Not a great experience at the olive garden there are certain things expected... The expectations are not that high shouldnt be that hard to do....
pos	Last night we met friends at Hillstone's and we truly enjoyed a great meal and great atmosphere.   We were met by a very friendly and helpful server who took great care of us the entire evening.  We started out with a wonderful wine recommended by our server she let us taste 3 kinds before we chose what suited us.  We went on to enjoy the savory spinach and artichoke dip as well as fresh baked bread served with some olives and olive oil.  The caeser salad was a very large portion almost could have been my entree and the dressing was so fresh and light.  The croutons crisp and fresh baked.  We all ordered the hawaiian ribeye OMG!! So moist and so juicy - the flavor was so fabulous and I could only eat half of it.  The loaded baked potato was also wonderful and very large.  I ended up taking half my meal home and was really happy that they let us sit quite awhile to chat with our friends after our meal was over (we were way too full for dessert however the server brought us a complimentary slice of key lime pie which my husband and friends said were fabulous I just was too full to try it) we never were rushed out and they kept refilling our drinks I can't wait to go back.  Was always a fan of Houston's in NYC and this was very much the same and enjoyed the jazzy low music in the background and the dim lighting that was warm and relaxing.
neg	I always have customer service problems with Fedex.  How the heck did they get to be so big with the crappy way they treat customers?  I use the Internet a lot for purchases and about 60\% of the time they screwed-up and then their customer service has major difficulty fixing the problems.  I have asked for shipments to be held at the closet shipping location to my office and they ship to my home.  Another time I asked for the same thing and they held it at the regional depot instead of where I asked that it be sent.  I can go on and on about the screw-ups I have experienced with Fedex.    But this time they really pissed me off.  I get a harassing phone calls from a collection agency that says they have been contracted by Fedex to collect an overdue bill from me in the amount of $4000+.  I have asked them for details and all I get is harassment.  So I asked Fedex for help and customer service told me to contact Fedex Revenue Services which I did.  I told them that I am getting harassing phone calls from XYZ collection agency and the person who keeps calling is named Chris.  I also tell them that the alleged amount owed is $4000+ and the account is supposedly in my name.  So I ask that they investigate and tell me if I indeed have an overdue account in my name for this amount.  (I know I do not have such an account!).  Fedex then tells me that they cannot help me because I have not provided enough information.  WTF?  How much more information can I provide?  Do they want my height and weight?  Maybe my blood type?  Maybe I have to provide the names and birth dates of my children too?  This is why I say that Fedex really blows!
pos	The mozzarella tomato and basil sandwich is the BEST sandwich in Phoenix hands down. If you haven't been to Pane Bianco you are truly missing out.
neg	I am *floored* that this place has 4 stars. Literally fell out of my chair picked myself up then continued on to write my review.   The staff is friendly at this restaurant - I'll give them that. It's relatively clean and has decent prices. That's where any positives end. The food here is absolutely disgusting. Nothing has any flavour - no flavour at all. None. Nada. The salsa is peppery water at best the beans are mush and the rice just tastes like plain white rice. I had a ground beef burrito which I'd think would be difficult to mess up... Nope. Not for these guys. The beef itself was unseasoned burnt 80/20 ground beef. There was at least 3lbs of sour cream. And for God's sake -- even the \"cheese mixture\" had zero flavour. I've eaten better pizza boxes. Pass on this places dudes.
pos	Was looking for something refreshing for a nightcap on a hot Scottsdale night. You will not be disappointed. The sorbet was really tasty and refreshing.
neg	HA HAHAHAHAHA!  \"Pit\" is right.... man this place would have been a terrible idea if i wasn't already expecting lameness. now occupying the space that has seen the death of not one but two dance club (411 and Level) Peach Pit Afterdark.... I mean Cherry Lounge and Pit is beyond ghetto. opened by the same people who do sugar daddy's and dos gringos this place has all the sexiness and allure of a Trails commercial. You know? I was half expecting to turn a corner to see a neon colored bikini-clad bleached blonde on top of a motor boat. well they've updated the look of the cage-trapped go-go dancers to mini panties with knee-high dragon rider boots with fuzzy muppet skins adorning them.  the vids of drunken lounge-goers (a la daddy's and now dos) playing in tiny screens on the walls in hallways and behind bars in tact interspersed with footage of seriously hagard looking chics doing \"sexy\" things like sucking on lollipops cherries winking (yes she was winking right at you wasn't she? inviting you in to her red-drenched lair to bask in the glow of a alcohol doused club circa 1992).  i'm not sure what the DRESS CODE we were so violently and largely reminded of in line but the girl in front of me had on an oversized T-shirt baggy jeans and flip flops (?) and they took her $5 and let her in no problem. i also saw a girl dressed exactly like peggy bundy...no joke spandex black calf leggings long spandwex shirt in orange heels and a giant boob belt. it was so incredible i took a picture. she was not impressed with my observation so i had to sneak the photo.  anyway.... take it for what it is a club owned by dos gringos guys on mill ave.
pos	still a big fan wonderful pizza!!! -- Remember to join their birthday club!!!-
neg	I bought a deal off of Living Social and waited a while to call them figuring they'd be swamped with business. Now I can't get them to call me back so I can use my deal. (NOTE: There were no reviews of this company on Yelp BEFORE the Living Social deal.) Of course Living Social is no help - their website says I need to call a consumer advocate in my area. This kind of thing I predict will be the demise of every deal-of-the-day site: the company selling the deal bears no risk of having to pay refunds if the business providing the goods or services doesn't perform. I have since cancelled my subscriptions to EVERY deal-of-the-day email out there. Lesson learned about TWO companies with no ethics.
pos	You like hotdogs?  Motor (thats me) says get in your Mommy's oldsmobuick and get over to TEDS!  AND you sissys that like \"sonoran\" style dogs talking smack about Teds go back to Tucson and eat your fru fru pineapple topped dogs with peanut butter.   This is old style 4th of July chargrilled hotdogs and hamburgers.  Makes my mouth water.  Ok so visualize and taste this in your mind.  First the juicy hamburgers that have the hardwood charcoal taste that makes your mouth water.  The crispy ice berg lettuce juicy tomato and onion make this a purist burger lover's dream.  Real good home made taste.   So now act you like you always do on the 4th of July and get an all beef hotdog.  First a warning.  You will crave their hotdogs after you eat em.  The crispy plump skin that cracks in your mouth and the taste is like when you were a kid and watching the fire works on the fourth.  Add the spicy brown mustard with their ketchup \"hot sauce\" and buddy you got yourself dilemma.  The dilemma you ask? Is do you order one more hotdog cause they are soooo goood!  Try the Italian for a spicy dog.  Don't start with me on the fries and onion rings.  Just make sure you wear your fat pants.  Motor out and going back for another dog.
neg	The Duce is a disaster.  As an Arizona native and a downtown local I root for cool interesting places downtown. I wanted to love this place. The 1st time we tried the Duce I was extremely let down by the customer service. The parking is atrocious. It's as if you are inconveniencing the staff by asking where you order food. They were out of just about everything we wanted to order. So disappointing.  However I decided to give them a second shot. Everyone has a rough night. We went to an event there last night the entertainment by Scandalesque was AMAZING... same TERRIBLE customer service from the staff at the Duce. Management needs to wake up. Great concept. Horrific customer service and staff.
pos	i have 2 words for you: passive. active. dividing the dog park into sections based on tempermant isn't smart it's f'n brilliant.  2 gates upon entrance and exit safe it up so i have no worries that my shelter dog will hit the streets again.  this dog park is clean the people are friendly and so are the dogs. finally a place where we can all get along.
neg	Dr. Pierrend is ok he will write prescriptions for about anything without really investigating if the are needed but he seems like a nice guy. The staff are horrible. They tried to charge me 2 times for lab results which are covered by my insurance. Refused to give me the results without billing insurance for an office visit. I would not recommend this medical provider to anyone. Everyone in my family has gone to PMG and has a bad story to tell. If you are smart you will look elsewhere for medical help
pos	I've ordered pizza and wings three times and the have consistently created perfection seriously.
neg	Very unpleasant experience. Creepy male doctor. Uncaring. And no help.  I went to this Urgent Care with a swollen ankle so painful that I was nauseous dizzy and having vision problems. The doctor interrogated me and advised me to get my head examined. I'm not kidding.   Mom was right: good doctors don't advertise. This place actually solicits Yelp reviews.
pos	I was inspired to visit Casella's after a coworker told me about their authentically Italian goodness. As my tummy growled today I was in the neighborhood so I knew just where to go. I walked into a simple yet clean deli. Immediately I was welcomed by the entire staff (I believe they are all related or at least family through friendship). They asked me if it was my first time in and I said yes so right away they started giving me a history of the shop and the tasty cuisine. Celebrating their 33rd anniversary (congrats!!) I learned that everything is homemade -- from the meatballs to the chicken salad. The owner said he goes through 40 lbs of chicken a week. He gave me a sample and the chicken was chunky and delicious. I'm not surprised he has to prepare so much chicken every week! The meatballs and freshly cut meat for Philly Cheese-steak sandwiches looked great too! The owner mentioned he is from Philly so better be ready for some authentic Philly and Italian style cookin'!   While I was there the owner was slicing some fresh provolone so I added that to the warmed turkey sandwich I ordered. The turkey was tasty the provolone was yummy and the sourdough roll tasted like it was fresh from the oven. It was $8 for a sandwich and soda but the sandwich was hefty enough that I saved half for later. As I walked out everyone said goodbye to me and I felt like I was leaving a family dinner.   In summary here's what made Casella's stand out:   - The very friendly staff - It's a local family-owned neighborhood deli celebrating their 33rd anniversary. Gotta support the local businesses!  - Clean decor  - Tasty homemade food that's on display for visitors to see  - A good family-style atmosphere that greets you the second you walk inside.   I'm not sure how it's taken my so long to find this local treat but now that I've found it I plan on becoming a regular.   Directions: Note that this is hidden in the Basha's strip mall (on the side of Granite Reef) but don't let that fool you!
neg	ZERO stars! I traveled from STL to SFO a few weeks ago (with a layover in PHX). I have a couple complaints; One I was checking 2 pieces of luggage in STL. One ended up being 14lbs. over weight (it was a cooler with food I bring home each year from my dad). I was charged an additional $90 on top of the $35 initially for the cooler to ship (including the $25 for my first bag- so $150 total)! This is an OUTRAGEOUS additional charge! I thought overweight bags were charged an additional $25 like other airlines I've had to pay at but $120 to ship one bag is just insane (and a set price for overweight bags is NOT listed on your website)! On top of that I paid $250 for a pet ticket so my baggage fees were $400 total... $100 more than my round trip ticket to fly. I couldn't believe that! On another note the woman agent helping me at STL was the most rude customer service agent I've ever dealt with anywhere! She was rude to me about the overweight baggage and then claimed my dog was too tall to fit in her carrier so she claimed she wouldn't allow her to fly. She raised he voice at me and called me \"a very inhumane person\" for making a dog ride like that for a whole flight; seriously making me cry. I fly all over the country to do shows with my dog and this has never been a problem including on the first leg of my trip when I bought the round trip dog ticket in SFO. This woman name-calling was totally inappropriate... people in line beside me were astonished. Since I had my round trip dog ticket purchased already and she was sick of fighting with me over it she let me go but told me the gate person probably wouldn't let me on the flight (and of course the gate person did). Between the dog crate episode and the bags I have never been treated so poorly and charged with such ridiculously high adage fees. I'm very disappointed to not be able to fly US Air anymore since I never had problems with them in the past. It was a horrible way to end a very nice holiday vacation. I have passed the word on to as many people and websites as possible not to fly this airline!
pos	Very very good lunch spot!  Was a little disappointed when I found out they didn't have pizza on their lunch menu. But when I tasted the prosciutto \"sandwich\" I didn't mind anymore. It was a great meal with a relaxing & great ambiance!
neg	Bad... food was horrible... do not waste your time or money
pos	My fav Mexican place by far!  They make the most delicious chicken tortilla soup and tacos I've ever eaten. Fresh ingredients and the owners are super nice. Love this place!
neg	We ordered $40 worth of pizza for takeout and it took almost 2 hours -- was told 20 minutes. We were not comp'd for anything. When I expressed my dissatisfaction they offered to give me $40 credit toward my next order. I asked for this in writing and they gave me the \"we can't provide it in writing -- we wrote your name down and have you on record\" line.  Guess what -- I called back a couple months later and they had no record. They refused to honor the credit....and were rude. I asked to speak to the owner and was told \"he's out of town.\" The pizza is mediocre at best. I have zero tolerance for businesses such as this. PLEASE spend your money somewhere else that deserves to be patronized.
pos	Great food!!!  Everything on the menu is good.  The bacon guacamole burger is next to perfection.
neg	Pros:  -No breed restrictions on dogs -Washer and dryer in unit  Cons:  -Awful and idiotic leasing staff. Forms will be missing or prepared incorrectly. -Rude and inadequate maintenance (be prepared to supply your own tools half of the time) -Trash divers daily that no one does anything about -No on-site security (you can call after 9 pm for a \"courtesy patrol\" but it takes them hours to arrive) and the front gate is NEVER closed -Vandalized cars  -A MURDER (this was the location of the man who set his pregnant girl friend on fire) -The main pool is beautifully maintained and clean. The 3 other pools are small dirty and frequently closed.  -Bug infestations in most apartments -Dogs kept on patios 24/7 (a clear violation of the lease) so their barking can be heard by all -The basketball court and tennis courts are never available as they are constantly used by kids to bike ride on with the encouragement of the apartment staff -Tons of potholes! Driving through the parking lot requires excellent shocks and there is minimal guest parking -The apartments have less insulation than a cardboard box. Freezing in the winter sweltering in the summer. Nothing is fitted correctly to it's frame either.   If you can afford a better place I highly reccommend it.
pos	Love all their dishes!
neg	Have been in twice since my last review. Its a like a COMPLETELY new atmosphere!! And sorry to say this is not in a good way. Service was terrible and I was emberassed that I actually brought some new people with me to try it out. Just went for this saturdays last ufc fight! They were like natzi's with the seating you have to have 75\% of your party with you to get a seat even though my boys were parking and in the parking lot they gave our table away so after getting the tenth degree abou there seating rules we were finally sat all had to sit speraticly through out the bar. We should've just turned around right then but decided to stay... then on top of that we were sat next to some drunk beligerent people spilling and flirting with there server (wich you could tell made her uncomfotable) that table were continuosly getting over served beers. Since there was not one mgr in sight the little time we were one of my boys stepped in and there was almost a fight right then and there.. putting that aside our service was horrible some dude was our server and we went without seeing him for like 30 min and not so cold beers. At that point after one round of drinks we decided not to order food and the table next to us was gripeing about there food so that was another sign to get the F out of there so we paid (once the server got back) then bolted. I wasn't going to yelp anything BUT I just received my checking statement and the dude added 5 to his 3 dollar tip. I gave the guy 3 on $12 he was lucky to have even gotten that. I'm going to find out the guys name and go to upper mgmt because this is not the first time i've heard of this happening there. With that said.. I WILL NEVER BE BACK HERE AGAIN! This place has gone down hill!! . DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY HERE !! Very disappointed
pos	To say this place is super rad would be an understatement!!  We for las noches de las luminarias.  And I wish we could've stayed longer also seeing the gardens during the daylight is added to the 'to do' list!    Having never been there the staff was super helpful in guiding us not to mention really friendly!  The music was entertaining and a good variety.  They also have a synthetic ice rink and you're allowed up to 15 minutes of skating if you're not shy!  The buffet they offered was a joke and I don't recommend doing it.  For 16.50 you're only allowed one trip through and other such silly stipulations... no thanks.     Other than that what a great place to go!
neg	If you are over 24 you are too old to be here.    First this place has beer.  Don't order mixed drinks don't order wine both are gross unless your sole purpose is to get trashed which is the mission of every underage and young young 20-something at this bar.  This is the place you'd go to with your fake ID because when you're 19 this is what you think a bar should be.  Expect people over drinking and throwing up very early on in the evening in the bathroom.
pos	This is really worth taking the time to see and experience.  The cost is very low - $5 per adult.  The garden is beautiful and peaceful with many areas where you can sit by yourself and reflect or just people-watch.  Also the lady in the gift shop is very helpful if you are a first time visitor.  Metro Light Rail stop at Roosevelt and Central.
neg	I had high hopes for this place and it is really too bad because I love to support the Phoenix area restaurants especially a Caribbean one and I had already been to the adjoining Rum Bar and loved the drinks but the food was bad.  It was not only bad but by all means avoid the daily market catch.  It was not fresh at all!  Very over priced!  For nearly $25 for a simple white fish they could have at least taken the bones out of the thing.  It tasted like it had been sitting around all day (or two) in its own juices and when I let the waiter/bartender know he just ignored it and then ignored us until we left.  I will never be back for the food.  The Rum flights are worth a trip there but that is it.
pos	Yum yum yum. Husband and I first went there early on a First Friday night and were pleasantly surprised to be seated right away. We didn't want anything too heavy since we were planning on doing some walking so we split the Spanish cheese plate which was delightful. The fig cake is delicious!! Splitting the plate made the bill pretty affordable and it was just enough to fill us up without overdoing it.  The server was very helpful in suggesting a champagne for me and red wine for husband. Don't remember what we had but my champagne had a strawberry in it and was perfectly bubbly.   Ambiance and decor is nice and mellow. We've since been back with friends and it has been enjoyable for both a date night and chatting it up with people. Enjoy!
neg	Cheap!  Cheap!  Beware!  If you order Chicken McNuggets from this McDonald's they will charge you 10 cents for each sauce packet over the alloted quantity.  Either go to another McDonald's where they don't charge go to another restaurant that values your business and NOT nickel and dime you to death or don't eat!
pos	I hardly ever get past their carne adovada. It's simply amazing. Add a couple of extra homemade tortillas to it? Can't be beat! I have had their pecan crusted sea bass also along with lamb chops (chipotle?) both very very good. Great atmosphere friendly competent staff...a winning combination. Get there early! Long waits after 6:00pm!!
neg	Until they get their quality under control we won't eat here except for lunch. We ate here last weekend and both had the roasted chicken. The problem was it tasted like it was basted in cinnamon and the sauce for the risotto had at least 10 whole peppercorns on each of our plates. I actually bit into to one before I realized that the sauce was just crawling with them. They could've strained them out processed them in whatever just don't serve me a plate with a bunch of whole peppercorns. This tasted NOTHING like the previous visit when I ordered the same exact dish. When we finally let the management know that our food was unacceptable he said the best he could do was a 20\% discount. Well. we  weren't looking for a free or discounted meal but rather some acknowledgement that they actually cared about the food. That never happened. Unless something changes the burgers are decent and that is about it.
pos	Great customer service nice owner. The broth here is actually the best ive tasted in Arizona.
neg	Do not get your oil changed at this walmart or any walmart. We got a oil change and they dented our oil pan and now it leaks and they are not taking responsibility for the damages they caused. I have only had my oil changed for the last year here and they are trying to put it off on someone else when no one else has clearly done our oil. The insurance for walmart wont even look at my vehicle and had already decided they are not at fault. I had a 3rd party appraiser look at it and they can only determine it was from an oil change. I have no other option but to take this to a lawyer.
pos	Yup. It's all true. Great food super charming place very intimate.   We sat outside on the patio under a heat lamp. Enjoyed the olives as a starter as well as some fried raviolis (yes please) and a caprese salad app.  Outstanding artisan pizza with as good a crust as I've ever had and homemade mozzarella. Wine was just ok but very reasonable. Server was attentive helpful and friendly. Owner came by a couple times to check in on us and was absolutely delightful.   Deduct a point for the proximity to the Handlebar J Saloon and the faux-cowboys arriving in limos with 10-gallon hats. Then add a point back for the near-fight we got to watch between a biker and the faux-cowboy who almost hit him with his Cadillac.  We'll be back and with more friends.
neg	It was my Birthday and my wife her mom a dear friend and I headed to Fleming's Steakhouse in Chandler AZ. We heard only great things about this place and wanted to experience their 'unforgettable' steak dishes. That we did unfortunately.   The restaurant was lovely dim-lit adequate atmosphere for an expensive steak place. We were seated immediately and tended to by the waiting staff. The small roll of bread and two kinds of butter were good but insufficient for four hungry souls and we polished it up right away. No one offered to bring more. Our waiter told us about the daily specials after which we ordered food and wine. After a short wait four large dinner plates arrived. I was the lucky one my steak (a large  rib eye steak ordered medium-rare which tasted very good despite two large blobs of fat) was sitting pretty in the middle of the large dinner plate. Nothing else on my plate just the steak. I looked around at my wife's plate and couldn't believe her fillet mignon was laying there in the middle of the large dinner plate without anything garnishing it be that a glaze a leaf a slice of whatever! At the prices asked by this restaurant it felt like an insult to each of us to have such a poor presentation of a steak!! We asked our waiter for a side dish mashed potatoes with Parmesan and when they arrived we couldn't believe it! There were no more than two scraggly potatoes turned into mashed potatoes or about a tablespoon of mashed potatoes per person. Mind you they tasted good but at over $9.00 per side dish? In short we left hungry and wondering why we spent over $200 for the entire meal.  Next time we'll go to a well tried place for steaks and more. Durant's downtown Phoenix and worth the drive.
pos	Had a celebratory lunch for a colleague today. We had a group of ten. Service and ambiance were great. I had the best burger I can remember. It was Lon's special burger; expensive at $16 but worth every penny.  Highly recommend.
neg	Terrible experience here. They cut up my foot when trying to remove a callus. Also they told me they used shellac when it was really gelish. Wish I could recommend but I wouldn't want anyone else to go through the same experience.
pos	This place is great!  I called at 8:30 am to make an appointment for that afternoon for 3 people.  The place wasn't open yet but the phone was forwarded to I think the owner's cell.  He told me he would be at the store at 9:30 and he'd call me back when he had the schedule in front of him.  Sure enough at 9:30 he called me back and was able to schedule our appointments for 3pm.  When we got there we were immediately brought back to a small room that had 3 big comfy chairs.  We sat down and a couple minutes later they brought in 3 tubs of warm water for our feet.  They reclined the chairs and started at our heads.  They massage your face head neck shoulders arms hands feet and calves.  The they tell you to turn over as they quickly turn the recliner into a massage table and proceed to massage your whole back side....all fully clothed.  It was just wonderful....and all for $30!  I definitely recommend!
neg	This place is worse than the IRS at least the IRS admits when they made a mistake. But these arrogant workers will be caught dead before they hear themselves say \"sorry for the inconvenience\" or \"we made a mistake\".  They gave me different information on two consecutive visits that I made then Dorrie some lady who obviously should not have been working that day because she was coughing phlegm all over my documents then after she asked me to wait by the counter for 10 minutes while their system updated.   I waited 1 hour and 30 minutes later I finally went to the information counter and asked for Dorrie... I was told that she had gone to lunch 15 minutes ago and was told to go talk to another lady. She just dismissed me and I went to go talk to the new lady who was also extremely rude and kept rolling her eyes and interrupting me before I could finish my sentences.  Basically i spent total of 3 and a half hours waiting and getting attitude and nothing was resolved because of their mis information and Dorries idiot customer service ethics and the last ladys pride..  not one person resolved anything and they all were too proud to say \"we apologize for the inconvenice\".  I recommend this place if you wanna be late to work 2 or more hours and having your mild mannered patience tested to the maximum.
pos	i miss this place so much it's insanity.   ten high kentucky bourbon is all i can say.. and i never really cared how bad i felt the next day.
neg	Maybe their dogs are better but breakfast sandwiches at Nathan's are disgusting! The English muffin was spongy the eggs greasy the bacon undercooked... And all premade and wrapped ready to melt together into mush with the cheese. Yuck!!!
pos	Unlike other reviewers I didn't like the buffet though my friends from work think it's a good value. However I've been going for dinner to Flavors of India for nearly three years now and have ALWAYS liked the food. FOI is my first choice for Indian cuisine in Phoenix out of the four other Indian restaurants in the valley I've tried.   Yes FOI is in a strip mall but once inside the ambiance is pleasant. It seems quite clean I never got sick from anything I ate there (that's saying a lot as I admit to being a fussy eater) and the waitstaff is helpful. Bollywood videos on the large flat-screen wall display in the corner are an unusual feature but the volume is low or completely muted so you can watch or choose not to it isn't distracting.   (Here's a footnote about that: I ate at FOI on the night of the presidential primary election. My dining companion noticed that most of the waitstaff was gathered around the TV in the bar watching electoral results so he asked our waiter if we could watch too. After getting the enthusiastic okay from the two other occupied tables it was quite late in the evening silent Bollywood was replaced by live news coverage with volume turned on).  Regarding the food: I love their mattar paneer (cooked peas in a tasty curried gravy with small cubes of homemade mild-tasting cheese).  My super-spicy friend gets the lamb vindaloo (super-spiced as he requests).  Tandoori shrimp chicken and tikka masala are good though a bit pricier the samosa appetizer (lightly battered and deep-fried cut vegetables) is fresh warm and crunchy. Regular and garlic nan bread are everything they should be biryani rice is overpriced (I'd stick with basmati rice as a side dish) and sweet lassi (a well-chilled dairy drink similar in taste and consistency to a vanilla yogurt smoothy) is a nice treat. My spicy friend says his gin-and-tonic was weak and they don't have ingredients to make a Bloody Mary but hey FOI is an Indian restaurant so I can't fault them too much for that!   Other pluses: open a bit later than many Phoenix restaurants (seating ends at 9:30 pm); very fast with takeout orders; there's lots of parking; the 16 North bus stop is nearby; silverware glasses white cotton tablecloths and napkins are always spotlessly clean.
neg	Experience with Hostess was rude. Service with a frown. Our waiter had attitude too. It was a birthday dinner and we were in great spirits..so this review is written with clarity. The margaritas were strong-check ok there. The shrimp appetizer was different and very good and $18 for four shrimp. We ordered two mahi mahi dinners (each $24)and they were RANCID. Yup. I said RANCID. We asked if the shrimp fajitas dinner had the same jumbo and they said they would have to charge extra (each entree was priced at $30) we had to pay extra for the beans and rice that they had left on the table-which was cold by the time the shrimp dinner--which came with 5 shrimp and onions.  Poor service with an attitude. Mediocre food to say the least...all over-priced. Never going back.
pos	Just had takeout from here. Amazing as always!!! Had the carne asada torta. DDelish!!!!
neg	One star is far more than they deserve.  The owner of the property spent an excessive amount of time barking out reminders of hotel policy was rude to guests and his staff.  The stay here felt more like being in prison with the warden constantly in your face.  People in the group that stayed were locked out of the room by management forced to pay made up fines.  The owner ruined the entire experience.  If this is how customers are treated this place won't be around long.
pos	The chicken was unreal good!  And the cornbread just as reviewers stated was heavenly.  It was light and very good!
neg	NOOOO!!!  Don't think about it!!!!  Had my windshield replaced by these schmucks. The morons tore up the interior of my car and damaged a speaker cover.   I had to call them about replacing the cover thrice they finally did and then I found out that there was a HUGE air leak in the corner. They never fixed the interior trim.  They sent out the same first idiots to plug the leak and they ended up breaking a ton of clips for a covering on my car ruining the windshield wiper covers and DOUSING my tweeter in water. I called immediately after they left and got harassed by a \"manager\" because he just had hip surgery (why is this my fault?!) and couldnt come until a week out!  Whatever incentives they offer are not worth the TERRIBLE craftsmanship and poor service.  I am exploring my options with a lawyer and have reported them to BBB.
pos	I am a big fan of this place either to stop in on a slow Sunday just to see what they have.  Their stock rotates pretty frquently so always new interesting things to find.  So far I've bought a vintage print an awesome dress that I have received tons of compliments on cool earrings and some other kitchen items.  The staff are always friendly.  When you go make sure you check out the Burt Reynolds beefcake poster they have behind the counter.  Great strore!
neg	Last night on my way home from work I figured I would pick up some dinner for me and my wife who is taking care of our newborn all day and has little time to cook for us. I ordered chicken limone the menu says serves two to three and we don't eat a lot so I figured it would fill us up. The price was 18.99 but I figured in a family style Italian place and we should have plenty of food.   I was handed my bag and I was sure it was the wrong order because it was so light so I checked it in the car and was shocked.   I see three small pieces of chicken in a big container with a small piece of bread and that's it!   So I figured they just forgot the pasta and went back in and asked the hostess and she said yes it comes with it then said no after thinking about it.   So how can they justify that price? It was so small there was no way it would feed 2 people so I had to cook pasta at home and then reheat our chicken in the microwave.  I worked in the service industry for years and this place is a joke!   FYI just because there's people with money who live near your restaurant doesn't mean you can tailor your food prices to their income level without delivering value.........if you sell crap in the worst neighborhood that same crap should be priced the same in a affluent neighborhood....same crap different place.  No value means lost customers ....

neg	Music was loud as shit.  The food Jesus Christ the food.  Lame ass chips and salsa.  No joke like 8 chips were on the plate.  Salsa was probably one of the worst I've had no flavor at all and warm.   Salads come out warm (I'm assuming this is why I've been puking).  Gross right warm lettuce.  Waiter let's us know they can make daughter a little quesadilla (cheese only) which comes out so greasy.  Our taco plates come out 10 minutes later.  2 dinky tacos on each plate that are flavorless and luke warm at best.  Yes they are spicey no that does not mean they are flavorful.  I'm literally using my cell phone to see what was on the plate it's so dark.  Mint water was warm.  Gross and not refreshing whatsoever.  My daughter's quesadilla was $13 yes for 2 tortillas smaller than my hand and some 'cheese'.  I get it- make a dollar but damn don't rip your customers off.  So over the top lame.  Neither my husband nor myself finished.   Meal was $46.  Horrible.  Health department should go temp that place- I'm not sure the refrigeration is working properly.  Such a disappointment I've been a vegetarian for 18 years- was looking forward to a new spot.  Won't be returning.  Ever.
pos	Dana there is no other like Dana!  Even my kids ask to go visit her!   I have 4 children 2 boys ages 3 1/2 and 5 1/2 and 2 girls ages 8 and 19 months.  Dana has been cutting their hair for quite some time. They all have a style of their own and have always been happy every time we leave. She has a great shop in Downtown Scottsdale convenient and is very accomodating.  Highly recommended by this Mom and her children!!
neg	I've never had a hard time at a sonic before except for this location. They barely speak English they don't know their own menu and they messed up my order 2 times. Come on your job can not be that confusing...
pos	Great little place in a great little neighborhood. Food was great service good and friendly and sitting amongst the rose bushes and garden made one feel as if we were having a nice relaxing Sunday breakfast in our backyard. Love the place.
neg	Made me and my bro sick. Tasted good at first but something wasn't right.
pos	Why am I trying to hide my love...  I'm at Gallo Blanco Cafe at least three times a week.  Yes it's totally convenient.  But then again so is that Rice Stick in a Bowl place around the corner and I'm never there!    I'm trading in my four stars for five stars.  I never get tired of the food (which is totally delish) the drinks the jolt in the coffee the servers...and THE HOTEL!!    You guys always treat me well and I can see you treat everyone else like a rock star too.  Thanks for being a great 'light rail convenient' local business!
neg	My wife and I were looking for a particular type of rose for our garden. We called this location and asked if they had it in stock and what the price was. They said they did and quoted us a price of $24.99 for a gallon sized plant. Good to go. We drive there and find the rose bush but it is listed as $44.99. So we go to the front and say that  we had called and driven 30 minutes to get this rose and we were told \"Oops...sometimes the  prices on my list up front right\". No sh!t Sherlock. So...will you honor the price quoted? NO.   So we drove down the street to A And P Nursery on Baseline west of Lindsay and got the same size plant that they were selling for $44.99 for $16.99.   Don't waste your time with these rip-off artists.
pos	love the food and the services but you neesd to weight at 350ib to eat the burgers for free the burgers are big and jucey
neg	I decided to try qwest as I was tired of Cox continually raising their rates.  BAD CALL! Cox may cost a little more but is completely worth it. If I wasn't locked in to a BS contract I would switch back right now.  Internet: I signed up for their \"Heavy Duty\" internet @ 20 Mbps. I regularly test less than 2Mbps on dslreports.com. The best I have ever seen is a little over 5. When I call to try and get it fixed they tell me there is no guarantee on speeds. That is why they advertise \"up to\" 20 Mbps...  Phone: Extremely poor sound quality very loud static and crackling shocking as this is what they should be good at. I called to complain they explained we would have to pay to have technician look at it. This was the day after install!! Helpful hint call back and tell them you want to cancel your account. The customer loyalty group is actually decent they sent out a tech free of charge. He fixed it after a couple of hours but acted completely put out that we wanted a clear line...  The bundle: Ah my favorite part and what has finally pushed me over the edge to submit a review...  I went with a bundled package (phone cable internet). The plan I signed up for was $147 a month. The first bill was $147 the second bill in I'm at $272.43. I can't make any sense out of the bill so I'm not sure why they think i owe this much. I love the fact that I will get the pleasure of wasting another hour plus of my day tomorrow talking to these fools.   The day this contract is up I'm going back to Cox and I'll be happy to pay more!!
pos	I love to come here from time to time when I'm in the area and I am always highly satisfied with the food and service. The menu is great and there's a variety of dishes for every taste. The service is great everyone is always really nice and the atmosphere is quiet and relaxed. Definitely a great place to have dinner/lunch with friends. I read some other reviews from people who complained about the food mostly these were meat eaters I'm assuming so of course they were not satisfied. This is a \%100 vegan restaurant note it.
neg	I've been boycotting this store since 2009.  One afternoon after browsing for a while with my kids I allowed my 10yo and 8yo to stay in the children's section to pick out a book to spend their allowance money on while I ran next door to TJ Maxx to buy the toddler a pair of shoes.  I'd been gone 30 minutes when I returned to find the horrid lady in the children's section had called the police on us.  She never asked the kids  their ages and didn't ask if they had a way to reach me (they did).  The police talked to them realized they were perfectly well behaved consumers and assured me I'd done nothing illegal.  Avoid like the plague.
pos	T. Cook's continues to be my go-to spot... with or without my fiance.  It's like my home away from home.  I feel comfortable going in for a drink or a bite to eat any night of the week.  Let me be clear about one thing however - I always sit at the bar!  In addition to the regular menu items the burger at T. Cooks is consistently amazing. This sizable delight is carnivore candy for the soul. Ten ounces of tenderloin burger with white cheddar cheese bacon and Guiness tempura onion rings on a ciabatta bun with a grain mustard aioli. My mouth is watering just thinking about it right now.  Anyone up for a burger?
neg	Went here one night with a group of friends. This place is pink crowded and really not that impressive. I ordered some sorbet and it was bland - that in itself is an accomplishment - bland sorbet.  The 50's style booth seats were very uncomfortable (maybe to discourage staying long?) and the tables were the wrong height for eating. I had to strain to get above face level of my food (and i'm a normal sized woman) It was also very very (very) loud in here.  I'll avoid going here again. The quality of the product was just too poor - I'd rather hit up a Whole Foods and get some good sorbet without the discomfort and echoing nosie.
pos	I just started taking my car here a few months ago. Someone from their business stopped by my office building with donuts and coupons for a 60000 mile check up and that's how they got my business.  I brought my car there for a routine oil change and they did the 60000 mile check up which was very useful. Of course there was the usual list of things I should fix but they never made me feel like an idiot or that they were taking advantage of me which I can't say for most mechanics.  The other thing I really like about them is they give me a ride to and from work so I can get maintenance done on my car without missing work or worrying about how I'm going to get back to the shop.  Bill and the other guys that work there are all very friendly and I definitely trust them with my car needs.
neg	I don't get it. This place is crazy busy with no Manager in sight and in hiding during the busy dinner hour. No name tags on the employees. I was scolded for pointing over the sneeze glass to the sauce that I wanted since nothing was labeled. I guess I violated the health code. Thanks for not locking me up. I told my family we will not spend one more dime here.
pos	I love Lulus cupcakes! They always have a perfect amount of frosting and alot of their cupcakes are better than the ones at sprinkles. This is because they seem to be moister and hold themselves together better.  I love the raven! The Sales people are nice.  So yummy! And I love that the place is pink!
neg	My g/f love sushi! She made me a connosiuer of it. and I have to be critical. So many college kids \"love\" RA but it's mediocre at best.  I'll just list a few things that irk me: I went during a happy hour with co-workers. It was PACKED. Good thing right? WRONG! Extremely poor service. when I went in to meet coworkers who already had a table the hostess told me I have to wait. When I said I have a table she got in my face. I was tired long-day and I wanted to chill. I walked past her found my friends and she left me alone. The waitress took quite a bit of time to get around to my table and the sushi servings were OBVIOUSLY LOW! I went to Zen 32 and now my choice is SakeBomber. their happy hour servings are much more than RA and their prices are BETTER!  Be ready for loud noises as every one is trying to talk louder than the music and the person next to them.  Just an overall poor experience. and I tip on service.   Food quality was so-so. Just don't go during a happy hour which is the only time it's worth it because it's priced so high.
pos	I recommend this to everyone.  I have never had a bad meal here.  Inexpensive great service off the beaten path. Love this place.
neg	Bad food but lots of it.  If you have a hangover and need grease this is your place.  Other than that drive a block and eat at Mucho Gusto down the street--now that is real mexican food!
pos	I've been going to Orange theory for awhile and I can't believe how much I've toned up and slimmed down!!! I haven't bulked up and now I'm on my way to getting my bikini body back!! I highly recommend this work out!! It's so awesome and I can't believe I can get my full work out in an hour!!!
neg	We came there on November 5 2011 and the service was very bad. The worst I have ever seen and we were treated like shit. We came into town from LA and Vegas for the NFL game and seen Mrs. White's cafe on Foodnet Work and knew the food had to be great. The chicken was great but the customer service was so bad we will never return again.  We got a refill on our drinks and the guy poured sum of our drinks on the left overs so we could not take our food back to the hotel. Foodnet Work shame on you for recommending this place. Just because the chicken is good does not mean you treat people like shit.   We had to remind the staff over six times to get our order. We waited over 40 minutes to get the other 3 pieces of chicken to finish our meal. We don't mind waiting but it was pretty rude when you are watching other peolple are getting their meals when they walked in after us. The Mac and Cheese did not look like everyone else's order- it look like it came out of a box. You can tell it was far from homemade it cleary was not bake no crust. The gravy was watered missing favor. Corn bread was over cooked under salted. The cornbread sure as  hell did not look like everyones else's cornbread. I felt like we received the leftovers.   Truly the worst service we ever received. The place needs to learn how to be respectful and just be nice.
pos	Oh my gooooooooodness!  I love this store.  I have been a tea enthusiast ever since I received a cast iron tea pot for Christmas.  A few weeks ago I purchased a Groupon for $20 worth of merchandise for $10 and headed over to the store.  The experience was amazing.  The varieties were intriguing the prices were reasonable and the owner was very knowledgeable and friendly.  Also the layout of the store was appealing and inviting.    When we visited the store we received a packet of tea for the stores 1st birthday.  I hope there will be many more to come.
neg	All I have to say is what you see on the menu is not what you're gonna get. and if you're ok with cockroaches on the walls and floors the this is the place to eat.
pos	I violated my rule of avoiding grocery shopping while hungry and decided to venture over to Whole Foods.  Whole Foods tends to be the indecisive individual's nightmare (that would be me).  Yet this store is a foodie's dream.   There are aisles upon aisles of glorious wholesome products (pun intended).  Everything is meticulously organized and there are at least ten varieties of every type of item.  No joke.  It took me fifteen minutes to decide which brand of bottled tea would be suitable (and economical).   I roamed the freshly prepared food section like a vulture circling it's prey...strategizing which choice would be the best taste sensation.  Did I want a made-to-order wrap?  Or a glass of wine and a couple tapas? (the live music was alluring)...Maybe sushi?  Pizza?  Salad bar?  Soup? Maybe something from the smokehouse...oooh! A cupcake from the cupcake bar?   On and on it went.   My final decision was sushi. The spicy tuna roll tasted fresh and the Pacific salad roll was very crisp. I also grabbed a container of ginger for $1.99--not the artificially preserved pink variety--all-natural pickled ginger.  Bliss.  I purchased some cucumber salad from the salad bar as a side/palate cleanser. All in all a very satisfying meal.   Prices are a tad higher than your average grocery store. Then again it is Whole Foods. A word of advise:  come with a game plan (e.g. a shopping list). If you don't define what it is you want prior to entering this store you'll end up spending two hours and twice as much money than you anticipated.
neg	Mucho Gusto es mucho mierda.   Let me say first that the place is cute the staff is friendly and the salsa is good. There. I'm not being a total jerk.   The food however left much to be desired. I couldn't find much to like about my chicken tacos- they were ok but the meat didn't have much flavor there was no cheese and they were pretty stingy with the guacamole and pico. What really got me was that they didn't come with rice and beans. Instead I got a lovely pile of cheap bagged romaine coated in some sort of caesar-ish dressing. Sure there were a few cubes of cheese and a tomato slice (A slice!) on top but come on. $14 for a couple of naked tacos and a pile of romaine? For that much they could have at least picked the white core parts of the lettuce out of my salad. Or I dunno sprinkled a little cheese on the tacos?  The story was much the same with the fish tacos only the salad was different. The enchiladas seemed to be a hit and those are served with rice and beans. the vegan at the table ordered a side of rice and beans for her meal and they aren't kidding about it being a side. I think my cat's food bowl is bigger.   They charge $1 per bowl if you want more chips. I know $1 isn't a big deal but it's just the principle. I already felt ripped off from the entree so the extra charge for the chips just made it worse.   Needless to say I won't be going back. There are far better choices closer to home.
pos	Beautiful little gem of a restaurant.  Great outdoor seating amazing-truly amazing mussels.  Wholeheartedly recommend perfect \"date night\" too.
neg	10:30pm on a Saturday night.  My friend and I try our second attempt at sushi for the night (see my review of Pearl for the first).  Place is hopping.  We take a seat at the sushi bar.  The Waitress:  \"Are you girls going to be ordering sushi?\" Me: I have a sushi menu in my hand \"yes.\" Waitress:  \"Would you mind putting it in soon because they want to go home too.\" Me: What the fuck bitch. \"Uh ok\"  Dear Ra Waitress  I'm sorry if I kept you or any other employess especially since I finished eating my roll before your kitchen even closed.  It was completely ok to rush me even though I had no intention of staying all fucking night and even though plenty of new sushi orders came after mine.  I was hardly the last customer in there.  There were people all around me ordering sushi so I'm still unclear as to why you needed to rush me.  If you were in such a hurry- why did it take you longer to bring and process my bill than it did for me to eat your food?  Maybe it was because you don't know how to count since you gave the wrong amount of change and I ended up having to tell you the correct amount since you couldn't count it on the spot.  I like Ra for the atmosphere something you completely ruined.  Thanks for that.     Sincerely Morgan
pos	The restaurant itself is not fancy and does not have an amazing atmosphere but I really love the food here. I've eaten in the restaurant a few times and frequently get takeout. I love the Gobi Manchurian Vegetable Vindaloo and Special Vegetable Curry. I also like the weekend buffet - it's a great way to try several different things. Delicious!
neg	My significant other had a $25 off coupon from Restaurant.com LOL. That could sum up the whole trip. I haven't been to many restaurants that participate with restaurant.com that are decent at all. I mean I wasn't expecting much coming into this place I shouldn't have expected anything here.  I was in the mood for some red meat and sushi places do actually have decent dishes like teriyaki chicken and stuff like that sometimes. So I didn't mind checking this place out since I do like a little bit of sushi on the side. The boolgogee plain simply plain. There was a salad with the boolgogee but it too was plain. There wasn't nearly enough meat to warrant a price tag of $8 because the salad and rice probably didn't cost more than $0.50 to make.  Oh the sushi? All of the sushi we happened to get were either super plain or super spicy. By spicy I mean that there were just too many tastes going on at the same time and it was too overwhelming. I tried a few bites of the 3-4 different rolls we got. After I tried each roll I thought that I liked it but that the taste was too overwhelming for me to want to try another bite. We paid $18 for the food even after the coupon and I honestly think that even at the price it might be a bit of a rip off considering you can get cheaper higher quality sushi at Teharu.  This place is a rip-off for sushi in my opinion. Its not good enough to warrant the hefty price tag. The sad part is that the interior is very well done if the food was actually good this place would be extremely interesting.
pos	Once we went to Grimaldi's in Hoboken NJ and weren't all that impressed.  Yet the first time we ate at this Grimaldi's we were blown away!    Upon entering you are enveloped by the aroma of pizza baking in a coal-fired oven.  This is swoon-inducing---and I mean that in a good way.  The smell almost has you believing that you are in a pizza joint with a coal-fired oven in the Northeast.  When ordering pizza baked in a coal-fired oven I like to get a plain cheese pizza.  IMO this is the best way to fully taste the sauce cheese and crust without anything else get in the way.    There's nothing like a thin crust pizza from a coal-fired oven with that char on the crust.  The crust has just the right balance of crispy and soft.  The sauce is well flavored with proper proportions of basil and oregano.  The amount of cheese is just right.  I love to savor each and every bite.  There is more to this Grimaldi's than the one under the Brooklyn Bridge.  This one has other items in addition to the pizza.  We like their antipasto.  It has sliced mozzarella which is fresh and creamy black and green olives (the black ones are pitted the green ones have pits in them)  roasted red pepper slices which are bursting with flavor and a good flavorful salami.  Everytime we're in AZ it is so worth it to us to deal with the heavy traffic in Old Town Scottsdale to dine at Grimaldi's!
neg	I have been here a few times over the last 4 years and really liked it.  It was horrible on Saturday night (5/28).  I ordered the enchiladas with chicken.  When it arrived there were 3 tiny enchiladas with an ounce of cheese inside the soggy tortillas and the \"with\" chicken part apparently meant a few chunks of chicken would be tossed on top.  I was so disappointed but starving so I ate it.  The guacamole was really disappointing too.  I don't think we will go back again.
pos	Championship establishment here.  I walked in with my significant other and was surprised at how busy it was on a Tuesday night. At first it didn't click but the entire volleyball team from a nearby high school decided to come so it was extremely busy.  They have some really good specials but what really caught my eye was the specialty burgers that are $6. Big misunderstanding most $6 are single patty and have some special toppings. Zipps decided to do a double-stacked specialtly burger. Yes two 1/3 lb patties on a bun with some special toppings. We got two burgers and split them half and half green chile burger and sweet jalapeno. Both were extremely awesome. You can get salad fries onion rings or half-half (half fries half onion rings). The fries kind of taste like In-n-Out fries and my significant other would describe them as being better. I don't agree and I don't disagree. Overall good food I can't wait to come back and try something else from their special menu. The $6 specialty burgers are available Tuesdays from 8-close and weekends from 11-4.  The service was really awesome. They definitely cared about us and went out of their way to make sure we were doing okay. I think they felt guilty that we were there when a huge group was there as well. Apparently they also were understaffed but it honestly did not feel like it. Seriously though it was some of the best service I've ever had at a Phoenix restaurant. To top it all off the manager had checked up on us a few times and at the end after we paid the bill he brought us a cookie platter (pizzookie or cookie with ice cream).  Now I'm not a fan of pizzookie but wow their cookie platter was awesome. It wasn't on special that night but I know its on special some other night and at $4 its probably worth a go again. Might I say one more thing about the cookie platter? It's just as good if not better than BJ's.  I am actually excited to go here again. With some really good food specials almost any night I think if I ever run out of ideas this might be the first place I think of. The food is a little greasy but I think that is expected when you go to a sports grill. Want to lose 50 lbs go to subway. Props to the owners for such an awesome establishment.
neg	NO.  Don't go. Don't do it.  This was my first visit and it was on a whim because we drive by it often.    One other reviewer here made a wise statement - go the grocery store and buy frozen fish.  I promise it will be better than this.
pos	This place is amazing! The food was delicious the waffle was like no other.  The service was great very attentive and nice. I will be returning.
neg	If you like sushi go somewhere else. I was extremely disappointed in the quality of both the service and the food.   I decided to take my family here because the other reviews seemed good; however either my experience was an anomaly or the other Phoenix yelpers and I have stark differences in taste.  The staff had great smiles yet lacked follow through. We had to ask for water and extra ginger twice. The sushi rolls were the flimsiest I have ever seen! Although poor in quality they were high in price for what they serve. I'm not sure about the names of some of their rolls...one was named \"Climax.\" Gross and just distasteful.    The decor and ambiance leave you wanting. They have three different wallpapers hanging and the music is overwhelming.   Even though this is the only sushi bar in Surprise I will gladly drive to Peoria or Scottsdale the next time I have a craving for sushi.
pos	We make it a tradition to come here whenever family is in town. So I've probably been here atleast 10 times.  Love their steak with buttered plates. We've had it before where the streak wasnt cooked to our satisfaction. But after being there so many times I know how to order it. Sweet potato casserole is excellent. Cesar salad is the best I've ever had. On this occasion the wait staff was very friendly but I've had it before where they are like buzzing bees. I usually like to have tea after dinner which is always nice.   The atmosphere is good. It is nicer to sit in the main dining area near the windows instead of the side room.  Also people if you are going to spend hundred dollars on dinner don't cheap out on a babysitter. Nobody wants to listen to your whinnying little brat kids who can't sit still. Ruth Chris should have an age requirement!  I've been to Mortons twice. Once in Chicago and once in Phoenix and both times it wasn't as good as Ruth Chris.
neg	My husband and I went to Ernie's a few weeks ago on a Saturday night because it is within walking distance to our house and there is always a crowd so we wanted to check it out. We met our friends in the bar and waited... and waited... and waited... and waited. Still no-one offered to take our drink order.   The bartenders and barbacks made eye contact but no-one came near us. We don't look like hooligans or ruffians or anything so it was irritating. The weird thing was there were people eating in the booths around us and one or two other people at the bar (who had drinks.) We finally got up and left. Why waste money on places that won't take it! I won't return and will recommend my friends don't either!
pos	Postinos on the East side!?  Whoa you like to think that you're immune to Postinos oh yeah It's closer to the truth to say I can't get enough  You know I'm gonna have to face it I'm addicted to Postinos   Thanks Robert Palmer and let's just say I wouldn't be surprised to see the fashion models around here.  Very attractive crowd!  I am honor just to be here!    Another bottle of wine and you'll be mine a one track mind  I can't be saved  4 flavors of Bruschetta is all I crave  If there's some left for you  and don't mind if I do   I might as well face it I'm addicted to Postinos  I've always enjoyed attending Postinos on the West side of town but the East side adds a new flavor.  The place still has a great deal on Monday and Tuesday nights.  Bottle of wine plus a large plate of bruschetta's for $20!  The ambience is always chill and low lighting.  Quite romantic and add some pretty ladies and I'm golden here!  Service is always great at Postinos.  The staff is definitely well train in the knowledge of wine and their service is spectacular! - Enjoy!
neg	Do Not Eat Here if you think a bathroom in any way has anything to do with the cleanliness of the food preperation.  There was literally dried smeared feces on the toilet seat and the floor looked like it had never been washed.  Of course the restroom cleaning check-list was not initialed the entire day. Oh...I almost forgot there were no paper towels to dry my hands.  I told one of the employess and he says \"I know dude\".  It's rediculous that the bathroom looks like this when you have 10 employess standing around with their thumbs up their asses gossiping.   Burger was over-priced.  Milkshake was ok.  Also no napkins anywhere in sight on the tables or at the bar area.  Apparently napkins are something you have to ask for?  Whoever owns this place needs to get a better manager at this facility because he is loosing money with all of the one-time customers who will choose to go somehwere else next time.
pos	Rula Bula gets five stars from me for two reasons:  #1 Perfect fish and chips. #2 One of the only correctly poured Guinness drafts in AZ.  They could punch me in the neck when I walked in and i would still give them five stars for those two reasons.  Almost all the food is good (though I can count the number of times I've had anything other than the above on one hand). The happy hour is great with half off appetizers including the fish nuggets which are the fish 'n' chips I eat before I eat the fish 'n' chips.  The world's most competitive trivia night. These people STUDY for trivia night.   Great outdoor seating good service. Decor is interesting especially if you like this particular famous race horse that I currently forget the name of but is the subject of approximately 90\% of the wall art.
neg	AWFUL.  Not sure it classifies as food.  Burrito consists of a flour tortilla and meat.  No salsa beans cheese sour cream guacamole.  Nada.  Plus they won't let you add anything to it.  Everything is as is.  The cheese enchalada had cheese but it was not gooey and melted.  The food was barely luke warm.   Service is also mediocre.  The salsa was gross.  It was super water down.  The best part of the meal was my Pepsi.
pos	One of my favorite places to come. Their salsa and guacamole is to die for. I like that they bring each person their own individual bowl of salsa.   I ways get their huevos rancheros with beans and rice + homemade flour tortilla. Delicious!!!  I eat the entire plate every time.
neg	THIS PLACE SUCKS!!!!!  It really deserves NO STARS!!!  You can only like this place if you don't know anything about Vietnamese food.   What I tried...  Bun Bo Hue:  Broth didn't even taste like Bun Bo Hue.  Spicy but has no flavor.  Where's the beef shank or hog's feet?  You can't have Bun Bo Hue without the shank or hog's feet.  They use the cheapest cuts of meat.  This item was on their Daily Special.    Pho Chin Nam:  The broth was super sweet.  You know what that means....MSG galore!!!!  Not even a hint of Anise star in the broth.  How can you specialize in Pho if you can't even make the broth taste right?  Service stinks.  I hate it when the waiter holds the bowl in such a way that his thumb is on the inside of the bowl while serving it.  The dude never refill the water ask how things were etc.  Vegetable platter was not fresh.  Bean sprouts were starting to brown.   If you can't cook something why even bother serving it to customers.  I don't know about other entrees they offer but I won't be coming back to find out.    This has to be one of the worse Vietnamese restaurant in the valley.   Check out my extensive list of Vietnamese Restaurants for suggestions to better ones.
pos	Great place enjoyed the amenities. Pool was great and view on the property was very picturesque. Food in the property restaurants were very good. Definitely would stay there again if ever in Scottsdale again.
neg	Horrible service.
pos	What would I do without this place?  They pretty much anything you need to make any Asian home cooked meals.  Very clean.  Fresh produce fresh seafood fresh meat.  I love how they have pre sliced meats.  This is definitely one of the largest Asian supermarkets in the valley.  Avoid the the 2 asian restaurants in the market though.  They're not very good.
neg	I love Saddle Ranch for its casual night time festivities (including watching people ride the mechanical bull hehehe) but I cannot ignore the fact that the food was disgusting!  When I think of my meal this past Friday night I think of two words: dry and cold. The spinach artichoke dip was just okay - a bit on the dry side and not very cheesy. The onion rings were just okay was well as the batter reminded me of the chicken nuggets at McDonald's maybe even worse. The BBQ burger (turkey patty) was dry and tasteless as was the bacon. Really? It must take true talent to cook bacon tasteless. There are a few things that the menu has going for itself - a few very unique and fun desserts and drinks that I have yet to see elsewhere. I am fond of the giant pile of cotton candy and though I'm not much of a beer drinker the beer tower looks pretty badass.  For me I came and will continue to come for the fun atmosphere but I will definitely be staying away from the grub. Adios cowboy.
pos	love. Love. LOVE.  How can you not fall in love with this store the moment you walk in is beyond me. It's like entering that magical fairy tale land your mind goes to every time I start to sing or sit down at my piano. And that's exactly what a music store should be. It should bring you to that creative center where the outside world doesn't exist.   First and foremost the staff is extremely friendly both on the phone and in person. I've spent I don't know how much of their time having them assist me in finding sheet music and they've always been a gem and even gone so far as to go google searches for me while I was there and give me some additional leads. It's just an awesome amazing experience.   They also never seem to mind me going in and gawking at instruments for hours on end. I always tell myself someday I am going to learn a new instrument and going in there causes me to think of at least 10 I want to play... especially when I stare at the drums.  Go to Milano and experience what a music store is supposed to be.
neg	\"HipsterTrendy\" ????-I think NOT !!!! Very disappointing......weird crowd ( older men on the prowl? )  and unfriendly bartenders w/ lots of attitude. I've given this a few tries thinking I just hit it on a bad night  but won't be going back. So many other great places in Scottsdale to visit !
pos	What else can I say that hasn't been said already?    I'm weirdly glad that they're not closer ( in fact very far away from me) because I'll be there every day = gaining tons of weight!  My baby loved the mango lassi flavor! So much he did the sign for \"more \" for the first time at the store:)  I do want to try the bacon flavor....so a trip soon is in order
neg	Went last night to Whore Foods to get basics to make pizza with most clutch to the process was a three pack of yeast. Low and behold the dirty hippie kids they have working there again didn't put something in the bag.  And this time it was the yeast.  I love the food there but the employees are nothing more than entitled hippie kids from Scottsdale who can't be bothered to do their goddamn jobs! I am so sick of this crap with this corporation. Maybe its a Phoenix thing or maybe its the hiring and firing processes of Whore Foods but I am done shopping at any Whore Foods. In a place like Phoenix where you have alternatives such as Sprouts you'd think Whore Foods would smarten up.  Or when you try to ask someone who works here where something is and they just walk by with their nose high in the air. I understand its important to show your fellow dirt merchants that you're a super star but I don't work with you I contribute to your salary and over inflated set of benefits for a grocery clerk so do your goddamn job. Useless little girl in need of a shower and orthodontist.   But alas Whore Foods and its dirty hippie employees have alienated yet another person with a job and a degree into hating everything that place stands for.  Oh yea one other thing take the concealed firearm prohibition off of your stores. It didn't stop Jared Loughner from doing something horrid and all it does is alienate law abiding citizens from their Constitutional rights. I understand you think that only parts of the Constitution should apply but honestly I think you need to pull your collective heads out of your ass and take a shower.  Useless motherf*&#$@s!
pos	LOVE THIS PLACE!  We eat here every Saturday as long as we are in town.  My husband eats here during the week too!  Weekday lunches are a great deal and quick!  The veggie soup is delicious.  The golden wings - Delicious... chicken satay is good too.  For an entree... we always get Pad Prik King chicken or sometimes shrimp but its always always delicious!  Have been trying to find a thai place with this dish closer to home (east valley) but haven't found one yet!  Service is terrific!  FYI for those of you who just order Pad Thai... it is very sweet here so if you don't like it sweet... order something else.  Other things we've tried that were good... pepper steak - very good - just dont eat a lot of red meat massamum curry with chicken good... also we order everything medium to thai hot... like very spicy!
neg	The food is delicious.  The service:  discriminatory.  The bartender blonde gentlemen went around to everyone else then finally acknowledge us.  This is embarrassing I don't know what else to say.
pos	Prices are good nobody is down your throat when you enter and its the best place for produce in town literally would suggest this place over trader joe's for sure
neg	Should have listened to the numerous negative reviews on-line (and there were many) but we trusted Guy from Diners Drivins & Dives ...BIG MISTAKE.   Clue #1 Strip mall with huge cheesy banner boasting \"Food Network\" endorsement. Clue #2  Self serves sign-in waiting list apparently the slimy owner was too busy gushing over customers trying to eat but steering clear of unhappy ones.  Misters and drinking water would have been a nice touch to make the 10-20min 104 degree wait more bearable.   The minute we saw the paper table cloths and plastic chairscups & utensils we were in trouble. One waiter frantically tried to service the whole restaurant which was a complete zoo. Now according to Triple D the pasta was homemade....aaaaaah.....not so much.... Ive been to Italy I know the difference.    Cut to the chase $27.00 for two a la carte / appetizer sized entrees.  Seems to me his only goal is cashing in on the TV appearance as quickly as possible with no concern to repeat business...  Don't waste your time and money....On a positive note Guy was right about Matts Big Breakfast in downtown Phoenix great good and the best costumer service we've ever had.
pos	I found this place via Google while in town for business. It's tucked away in a non-descript strip mall next to a Salvation Army.  I've had dinner and lunch here both times were good. For dinner I had the special turkey sandwich with fries (fries weren't pipping hot when they were served but still good); for the lunch visit I had the original \"g\" spicy po-boy and chose the curry pasta salad as a side - tasty!  Service was friendly and efficient. _______________  Update:  12/10/07 - What's the first thing I do when I arrive in Phoenix? Punch in 2240 N. Scottsdale Road in my GPS and head to Green! This time around I had Thee Argentine Po-Boy with fried - Mock steak fried with onions and peppers vegan mayo and a spicy sauce. I couldn't get enough! Very delicious  12/11/07 - After having a veggie burger and fries for lunch at a Hard Rock Cafe I thought I'd balance it out by having something healthy for dinner - I ordered the Diablo Rice bowl with chicken and brown rice. The description looked good: veggies in a spicy sauce - but it was a little too salty for my taste and didn't finish it. Oh well can't win them all.  12/12/07 - I was working close by so decided to run in for lunch. I ordered the No Harm Chicken Parm sandwich with a side of tahini coleslaw. It was a little bit messy to eat by hand with the tomato sauce and soy mozzarella oozing everywhere - still good nonetheless. The coleslaw was a nice compliment to the sandwich.  12/14/07 - I'll miss you Green!
neg	Confession: I am an obnoxious asian food snob. I really try to take that into consideration when I rate places. I haven't lived in China or anything but I really really love eating chinese food.   I also hope to convey to you that I am still American at heart. I hate Panda Express but I truly truly worship an excellently prepared orange chicken.   Be that as it may there are instances in which I have to suspend my courtesy toward less-than-perfect food because the product that I received was not only poor quality but insulting relative to the price I paid. This is the experienced I received ordering from Chopstick express.  I ordered Chopstick Express' family special for me my roommates and an incredibly hungry foodie friend of mine whom happened to be over. Upon reaching an orderer it was refreshing though annoying to be talking to what seemed to be an obnoxious teenager being forced to take orders. Whatever water off a duck's back. Quack quack. We ordered orange chicken cashew chicken and brocoli beef which came with fried rice and egg rolls. It was supposed to come with crab puffs but they were not delivered which I felt was almost an insult.  All the food we received was lukewarm at best cold at worst. It's chinese food. It can hold at nuclear temperatures and I don't think it snobbish of me to assume that delivery people can afford to invest in a proper traveling method. I must admit my major problem with this is the fact that it took nearly an hour for the delivery person to get here. Which means assuming that the food left fresh it spend a half-hour uninsulated. I don't believe I'll get sick from this food but considering that being served very hot food is clearly the industry standard it still seems sketch at best and disgusting at worst.    I digress. At any rate  the food was as follows:  Orange Chicken: The pieces of orange chicken were about the size of medium-sized chicken tenders. They were then covered in a weak breading fried unevenly and covered in a tolerable orange sauce which was the only saving grace of the dish. It came deeply compacted in a chinese take-out paper box which was problematic for this dish because the chicken essentially came out in giant clumps.   Brocoli beef: Easily the best dish but only by reason of advantage. The brocoli was tender though strangely bitter. The beef they chose to use was akin to stew beef which is the really thick fatty cut used in crock pots for stews because they have the capacity to cook for ever and ever amen. This resulted in incredibly large chewy chunks. I gotta admit Panda owns brocoli beef and chopstick express could take a few pointers. The sauce was decent enough yet ultimately forgettable.  Cashew chicken: offensive. bland strange. The sauce seemed to be more like cream of chicken than the savory peppery sauce to which I am accustomed. I ate maybe two cashews in my share which is boring. Interesting to note was the presence of noodles in the dish despite the fact that we were also given rice. And peas. Peas?   White rice: Nearly impossible to mess up and only when exceptional is worthy of meditation. Average rice though served essentially at room temperature which dried the rice out.  Fried rice: Shocking. In case you read my review Chopstick Express please take note: your fried rice sealed my distrust of your food safety practices. Fried rice is cooked fast and hot but because of the quickness of the cooking never dries out. This looked burnt. Literally burnt. Or seasoned with something both bland and dark as all holy hell. Fried rice should not appear to be dried out burnt and dark as chocolate.   Egg rolls: I don't trust these. They were almost cold to the touch.  Crab Puffs: not present in my order. THOSE ARE MY FAVORITE. D:  Summary: Steer clear away from this place at all costs. The advantage of living so close to Mekong Plaza means not being terribly far away from decent chinese and vietnamese food and I feel like I have disappointed my tongue by attempting to branch out. If these strange in congruencies aren't addressed by the management of Chopstick Express I worry that like what happened with me they will lose crucial local business and be forced to close. I don't know maybe it was an off-day. But in my opinion if something takes an hour to get to my place when the drive is 10 minutes tops it better sparkle and wow. Chopstick Express in its disparaging food disturbing distance from food safety and respectability and excessive delivery time means that I will never eat from them again.
pos	No need for a long review.  Every In-N-Out I have ever been too has been amazing.  Great Food Great Customer Service  Love this place
neg	I was very disappointed in the customer service that I received from Jiffy Lube.  I went in with a coupon for a 29.99 oil change and walked out pay $80 for services that were not discussed beforehand.  When dealing with mechanic's I've always been skeptical and this place did not change my mind.  I am in need of an honest mechanic that isn't required by their employeer to upcharge the customer.  I will never return to this place again.
pos	I love Petco! The only place I go to get dog food. I feel like the employees generally know what they are talking about and are always willing to help!
neg	this might be the worst KFC in the world.
pos	Wow is this some fantastic food! It was the first non chain restaurant we ate at during our vacation and I couldn't be more pleased. Not only was the staff friendly and attentive the food was phenomenal. Presentation and taste were top notch. The Tai fried rice was the best fried rice I've ever had. I will definitely be back the next time I'm in town.  Visit Date: 11/18/09
neg	Over one year later this review is behind but wanted to get it out there... as I can still remember how terrible this place treated us. Hopefully they've fired the manager and upped their customer service...  We have been coming here for a couple years until last Spring training 2010. We had a party of 10 people. We loved going here because of the vibrant atmosphere and the sushi. So what transpired was this. We had a reservation obviously it was busy so even with a reservation we were seated an hour and half over our reservation time. It was fine as we ordered drinks by the bar and waited. We then got our table it took another half an hour  to order and another 45 minutes to get our food - so time frame was now almost 3 hours since we got to this restaurant. Half the people got their food and took another 15-20 minutes later for the rest of us to get our food. It was a lot of waiting...We ordered more sushi and it took another half an hour. Really - rolling sushi would take that long?! So we wanted to talk to the manager. They sent someone over and told him what happened. This is what he said \" If you didn't like the service go ahead leave we have a ton of business and we'd rather turn the table for other patrons!\" So I said reallythis is how you address the situation without appologizing even and telling us to leave. We asked again to talk to the manager...he said I am the manager. What?! Everyone was so upset by this point and threw their money for their food on the table and left. This was the worst service I've ever gotten anywhere - ever! So to Ra Sushi - you've lost 10 customers for life...
pos	LOVE this place. Great food high quality ingredients (which is why i was told the prices are a bit more than your typical pizza hut) and fun service.  I love this place and always leave happy and full. Authentic italian food is my weak spot! :)
neg	cons: no tea at a KOREAN restaurant no water refill even though they should know it's like 200 degrees outside in PHOENIX and really do they not realize how spicy the majority of their food is?? waitresses didn't know what the hell they were doing didn't let me replace beef for pork and yes i'm just being petty as this point but their pen had no ink when we signed the receipt but we were just too fed up with everything else!   pros: very clean place (because it's fairly new) especially the bathroom.   i know there aren't many korean restaurants in phoenix but don't eat here. they really have no clue how to run a restaurant.
pos	We loved this place.
neg	Have been there twice in the past few months.  First time was during the busier snow bird season.  My wife and I were seated quickly.  Order was taken and then they forgot about us.  Tables next to us got their food quickly but ours never came.  Spoke to the manager who offered to quickly make our entrees but we left since we had somewhere to go.  Tried it again about 3 weeks ago.   It was not busy but the service was again terrible.  We wanted to order drinks but could not get the attention of our server who was standing at the ending of the room talking to the other servers.  We finally had to ask one of the busboys.  Our food came relatively quickly.  My wife ordered a hamburger.  It was so greasy that the bun was saturated with grease and not edible.  We complained to the manager who offered to bring her another.  We decided to leave after finishing the appetizers. Would not go back.  It is unfortunate since we live  min away and would love to have a good neighborhood place.
pos	One of favorite happy hour places in town. If you get the wings here it shouldn't matter if you get anything else. Great location and nothing else needs to be said. Maybe a renovation on the parking lot.
neg	The food industry is tough and these guys didn't knock my socks off infact they didn't even snag or give them a gentle pull...food was bland and something was off...I'll give em about 4 months before they are out of business...go to bryan's bbq in cave creek if you want good bbq.
pos	Love the wings!
neg	Shame on the owners of Haus Murphy's for participating in the sham of a TV show \"Mystery Diners!\" When the producers promise free publicity and you so easily lie to the public - that is not a business I will support. The \"manager\" under scrutiny on the show was an ACTOR - not a relative and not a manager. The show the conversations the issues......all phony. Entertainment is one thing but. I do not respect this at all!
pos	Simple but really great cajun food prepared in steamers right in front of you.  Selections include gumbo pan roasts (a tomato-based broth with chunks of seafood) or seafood creole all with your choice of shrimp crab chicken crawfish oysters or all five with rice. They also have fresh oysters jumbo shrimp cocktails salads and tasty seafood chowder as well as the occasional lobster special. I've been probably 20 times and still never had a bad dish. The staff is friendly and helpful and will adjust the spiciness of the dishes to your taste. By far the best option at the Talking Stick resort.  As another reviewer noted this restaurant is really just a bar with a couple of tables stuck right off the casino floor. This is definitely not a fine dining spot with the clanging of slot machines and dead-eyed gamblers shuffling around fifteen feet away. Still it's definitely worth a visit to Talking Stick. At $10-12 for lunch portions and $17-19 for huge dinner servings and $25 for a massive platter of oysters shrimp crab mussels and clams it's a fantastic value for the quality and tastiness of the food.  Good reasonably priced seafood can be hard to come by in the valley but this spot is a gem.
neg	UNION HILLS AND 7th AVE LOCATION!!  I went to Roberto's 3 or 4 of times the food is pretty good nothing amazing though. The staff isn't too friendly. On my last visit after I ordered and was waiting for my food I noticed I never received a receipt and was over charged roughly $2.50 on my $10 order!!!! Thinking back I realized I had never been given a receipt during any of my prior visits. I didn't even bother saying anything. I guess the tips I left in their tip jar just weren't enough. When I got home I went onto their website but no contact email was listed I then tried calling their restaurant in Anthem a few times to possibly speak to a manager no answer. No need to say I won't be back.
pos	Sometimes it's difficult to really feel satisfied with a raw vegan diet  but every time I go to Pomegranate's I leave more than satisfied.   The atmosphere is welcoming and delightful although very busy during the lunch rush. I did have to share a table with a stranger last time I was there but the stranger turned out to be a great lunch companion.  This is a must for anyone who is considering (or already is) a raw and/or vegan diet.  Everything is so yummy you won't know it is good for you!
neg	Being from Chicago we are used to getting authentic Chinese food all the time.  But when we first starting spending a lot of time in Scottsdale/Phoenix we found it a challenge to get authentic Chinese food.  We were excited to find the Golden Buddha and have made many trips over the years all the way from the Troon North area to get our fix.  However service has declined to the point where it is no longer worth the aggravation.  We went there last night for Chinese New Year and will never go back.  Granted they were very busy because of a lot of large tables there but waiting almost an hour to get our food is not acceptable under any circumstance!  45 mins. into our wait the waitress came back (after we flagged her down to ask about our food) and said one of the dishes we ordered was not available....after 45 mins.!!!! What makes the whole experience an unforgivable one is that the manager/owner is so indifferent and never apologized or offered a discount off the bill...nothing.  When we left the same manager was at the piano singing in Chinese. Huh?  Other than Nee House in Scottsdale the search goes on for a restaurant that serves authentic Chinese food closer to home.
pos	Simply awesome! Great beer and great staff! Will try the food next time! Only complaint is a bartender named Adrianne she is crazy! Ha! G  The food was excellent from the great hard boiled egg dish to the peanut butter and jelly with banana and marshmallow fluff oh and add bacon.  Elvis just did a sommersault in his grave.  The sandwiches are not huge but they are all made like the beer served and the people hosting of finest quality!    Really enjoyed and will spread the word!
neg	Poor service and very poor food. Chicken in the fajitas tasted expired. Would never eat here again.
pos	Best breakfast in west Chandler!  I love their crepe eggs and calorie/nutritional info printed on the menu.
neg	Pricey little sandwich joint and cheap atmosphere.  That's the best way to describe this place.  Indeed my belly was full -- full of bread.  Where's the beef!?  --- oh the 80's!  My sandwich was mostly bread lettuce and tomatoes.  The clam chowder was probably the delight of my meal (sandwich & soup combo) Couldn't complain much about the service since it was quick.  The place was super cheap on the decor -- though I did appreciate the helicopter ceiling fan.  Think I enjoyed that more than my sandwich -- Enjoy!
pos	While we were in Mesa AZ for a holiday we found Alessia's on Yelp and we are so glad we did. The food was delicious and the host was terrific as were the servers. We are not big wine drinkers but they have a very good selection of wines and the host knows his stuff and can make good recommendations. Nicely appointed little restaurant with a great menu.
neg	I waited for the store to open at 8 AM the day after Christmas..... but they had the same discount they had before Christmas so shop other stores.... A crowd of people were milling around the front of the store speaking to the manager asking why they did not make down the Christmas merchandise as they were told it was going to be marked down by store employees before Christmas. Quite a few people were told the same thing.... yet the manager did not handle this very well and quite a few people walked out....... shame on you Garden Ridge !
pos	I used to go here about once a week when I still lived and worked in Arizona. My office at the time was within walking distance.  This is a very good Hooters location...located smack dab in the middle of Mill Avenue right next to ASU. Plenty of stores all around.   I used to go mainly for lunches during the week with co-workers. It usually was quieter than evenings or weekends. The serving staff were great and many of the ladies would stand and chat for quite a while...as it was pretty slow.
neg	Well...these days it is difficult to find anything positive to report about an airline. US Airways delivers nuts and bolts in an average way (meaning the plane works technically and delivers you to your destination for a reasonable price). Mostly on time.   They could stand out from this averageness however if they would not make so many Nickeling and Diming efforts. For example the seat selling techniques applied are just downright counterproductive. When checking in on line all seats except the pre-assigned center seats (different rows even though we bought tickets together) were $15. This of course to compel you to spend another $30 to sit with The Wife (yes $30 since there was no purchaseable seat right next to one of the pre-assigned centers....psychology anyone??). Then we were almost late at the airport but still went to the underused check-in counter. We asked if we could sit together. Result: Reclining exit row seats for free in a half-full plane.  Then we proceeded through the half empty airport and found out that we could actually go on a 1hr earlier plane which was not full. However the representative at the gate wanted $50 per ticked to make this change...again the Nickel and the Dime! Do they realize how bad this looks? Letting us on would not have cost anything but would have left us with a happy memory...corporate numb nuts! Anyway we went for coffee saved the $100 and went on the booked plane. Can't be Nickeled and Dimed!  More from the US Airways front (6/2011). It appears that they are stepping up their \"force people to check bags to collect more revenue\" efforts. Sitting at the gate the loudspeaker blasted something like: \"If your bag exceeds the size box and you will not check it right now but wait until we detect your outsize-baggage-sneaking-in attempts at the gate when boarding you will be charged for the bag when we check it in\"-very nice. Several people immediately ran to the counter and checked their bags (for free). Then when finally boarding my bag was singled out and put towards the \"sizer\". It was slightly too thick and the clerkess immediately blasted: this must be checked...but then she got distracted and another less-eager clerkess winked at me and indicated me to move on the plane...lucky me!  Bottom line: It ain't getting better in those 'friendly skies'! Fly Southwest if you can!
pos	After visiting family in Scottsdale last weekend hubby and I spent 3 wonderful days at the Boulders Resort in Carefree. We arrived a little tired and stressed; we left tan relaxed and rejuvenated.  The resort sprawls beneath the boulder formations but you can walk all over on the paths that are well marked. Our room was spacious and clean with his and hers sinks in the bathroom shower tub king sized bed and walk-in closet. We were located near the main lodge and a brisk walk from El Pedregal and the Golden Door Spa. We made great use of the wonderful fitness center and took a few classes as well- yoga bosu and water fitness.  We tried both pools during our stay the spa pool and the main pool. We preferred the tranquility of the spa pool; food and drinks at both locations were exceptional. If you meet Madonna at either pool ask her to make the \"Madonna Special\" for you. A very refreshing smoothie.  During our stay we ate dinner twice at the Spotted Donkey Cantina at El Pedregal- fabulous margaritas shrimp tacos. Our last night we dined at Rusty's Chop House at the golf club. It was a lovely meal on the terrace with a view of the golf course.   Every person we ran into was exceptionally friendly and genuine making the trip even more enjoyable. I hope we return someday!
neg	Terrible!  Just terrible!  Poorly organized from the minute you drive up to the place.  Where do I begin?  The layout of the place is in NO WAY set for a festival for hundreds of people.  The \"convenience\" shuttles were not-so-convenient as there were only 6 operating for the HUNDREDS of people needing pick-up and drop-off. (It was faster to actually walk back to our vehicle.) The ticket line was convoluted and chaotic; there was no order to the line & one of the cashiers didn't have any one's so he motioned for people to get in another (so-called) line.  The balloons were never blown up as it was apparently too windy to inflate them (although the wind was minimal in my opinion).  It's like - Duh - don't have a balloon festival in a place known for high desert winds and is in no way set-up for hot air balloons!  The vendors sucked.  The band sucked. The employees/volunteers couldn't answer any of my questions. About the only thing good to come out of the event was that their beers were decent and you get to see the grounds of the Carefree Resort.  Other than that?  No Thank You!
pos	They have the BEST Pad Thai!  I've had many other dishes of theirs which are all delicious but that Pad Thai haunts my dreams at night. (In a good way)  I've recently had Touch of Thai which is a highly rated Thai Food restaurant.  Of course I had to try their pad thai.  Honestly It was just as good but they used the thin stringy noodles and Dara uses the wide flat noodles.  You wouldn't think that would make much of a difference but that's what makes me drive 20 miles more to go to Dara Thai to get their Pad Thai than driving 5 miles to go to Touch of Thai.   If your not watching your calorie intake I highly suggest getting the cream cheese wontons and Thai Tea with your Pad Thai!  Now that's what I call delicious!
neg	Sushi places are a dime a dozen in this town and in my mission to try them all I met a friend at Stingray for happy hour.  The food was decent.  I've certainly had better.  The las vegas roll was a little heavy on the rice and tempura.  The drinks were exceptionally good.  I had the asian blonde which is lychee and champagne can't go wrong there.  My friend's drink was something with raspberries and rose water.  It was amazing.  All that being said the service was awful.  Once our food was delivered our waitress disappeared.  I got one refill on my water and considering that I drink water like its going out of style this is completely unacceptable.  My empty glass sat on the edge of the table for the remainder of dinner.  Once we were done eating we couldn't get the bill as our waitress was still missing.  Some 20+ minutes after we were completely done eating she appeared again and we requested the bill.  Once the bill arrived it took the waitress an additional 15 to 20 minutes to come pick it up.  It was taking so long that I actually held the bill and credit cards up and out past the edge of the table hoping someone passing by would offer to take it or atleast offer to send our waitress over. Busboys went by the hostess went by several times other waitresses went by  the manager even went by and they all pretended like they didn't see me holding the bill.  I've never had such a difficult time trying to get someone to take my money; it was truly infuriating.  Stingray is definitely getting crossed off my list.  I don't have time for bad service.
pos	Baffled by the unfavorable reviews here. Easily one of the best burgers I've ever had is the Zinburger. Truffle fries are also delicious. Always have good service here and leave very satisfied. Atmosphere is slightly upscale I suppose but not snobby as some complain. You can wear shorts and a T-shirt and feel right at home here.
neg	Absolutely terrible. I am fond of wood burned pizza don't get me wrong. But the wait was atrocious--2 hours just to get a table. Then we were rushed in and out and told to scoot our chairs in--The place is way too small! There are so many better places to go that need the money--I dislike trendy places that are too crowded were they treat you like an average widget to milk money from.
pos	This place is what Desert Ridge wishes it was! Its great for groceries (Wal-Mart) bargain hunting (TJ Maxx) fast food or dining in (tons of places!) catching a movie (Harkins) stocking up the wine shelf (BevMo) new panties (Vicky's Secret) and a zillion other things. I love that this is close to my house! The only thing that would make it better is a Costco or Sam's Club.
neg	This update is not because I went back to Rosie's but to share the comment I received from my server. I really think it's in poor taste she felt the need to contact me and makes me NEVER want to give business to Rosie's ever again. In my review I relayed the events as they happened I'm not going to sugar coat it. I still think the cost of my friends drinks should not have been charged to me and it's not that my friends are \"unreliable dining compainions\" it was not their fault their drinks were not charged to them and they didn't notice. The server is the one who rang up the order and made the mistake she should own up to it not blame my friends or get pissy with me. It's really too bad that I don't want to give my business to Rosie's because I really do like it there and I really wasn't that upset with the server just the situation. I still stand by the fact the drinks wrongfully charged to me should not have been my responsiblity. Doesn't matter if the drinks belonged to my friends I shouldn't have had to pay for the mistake the server made.   Here is her comment: I was your server that evening and do not appreciate that you feel servers should have to pay out of our own pockets for your friends mistakes.  We seperate checks to make things more convienent for you.  Most places do not allow split checks.  I am sorry your friends skipped out on their portion of the tab.  Maybe you should find more reliable dining companions. As for the one beer on your tab that indeed was my mistake and if my memory serves me correctly i quickly and kindly apologized for MY mistake and swiftly removed it from your tab without any friction. Can't wait to see you again soon.  Rosie's always tries to give a good experience to it's customers.
pos	Had the mahi and it was great.  Very reasonably priced also.  Definitely a repeat.
neg	My inner-nerd was excited to hear about NTN Buzztime and team trivia so I was stoked to come down and try this place out.    I wasn't stoked however to learn that NTN and team trivia were two different things.  And I wasn't stoked to wait 10 minutes for our server to wipe down our sticky table.  Regardless this place's parking lot was packed and the bar was buzzing with Thursday night football and baseball fans drinking down pitchers and pints.  Aside from the pool table and shuffleboard as if that alone wasn't awesome enough - they have FOOZBALL too!!  The food and service was pretty average. I ordered a grilled chicken and ortega chile  sandwich with Monterey jack cheese.  It tasted pretty bland - I ate only half which if you know me means it must have been pretty blah.  The fries were the zesty seasoned variety - probably frozen but were still pretty good.  Rum and cokes here were standard as well.  Glasses were shorter than expected but neither too weak nor too strong.   Now to the trivia.  It's team driven and can go kind of slow.  So the bigger the group at the table the more brainpower (but also the more likely for differing answers and arguments).  For my friend and I who thought we were at a disadvantage - we coasted to 3rd place (out of 10).  Not too bad and we won a gift certificate back to Hazelwoods.  I'll use it someday I'm sure.  Like when I'm in the neighborhood or something.  Not in a big rush.   P.S.  It was Grover who was on the cover of Sesame Street Fever in case you're wondering.  EDIT: 11/07 Ok I'm downgrading to a one-star review which is for the understaffed Saturday when I went to watch Big-Ten football and have some lunch with a gift certificate.  One server to about 30 people in the entire restaurant portion.  To add insult to injury I paid with a $10 GC and left a $2 tip for an $8 lunch and the server chased me out when I left and couldn't wait any longer.  Service was so slow and the attitude of the server toward me in the parking lot was uncalled for.
pos	I have been living in Arizona for 4 years and have yet to find a decent Italian Beef Sandwich until now.  I even gave the same statement to the owner.  I had ordered an Italian Beef for carry out and while I was waiting I let him know my frustrations.  He gave me his card and told me to call him after I ate the sandwich because he wanted to know what I thought.  Well it was FANTASTIC!  Of course I called him back to let him know.    The service and the time and effort put into the food cannot be beat.  This is what you get for a mom and pops type place.    There are plenty of other sandwiches and foods there too.  I can't wait to go back and try some more!
neg	I went to this location because of a Groupon offer.  It's just a little strip-mall joint with zero atmosphere but I planned to take the pizza to-go anyway.  I ordered a thin-crust pizza and after waiting 25 minutes I was told that they had burned it and they had to start over.  Reluctantly my family and I waited for another pizza.  This time it took 30 minutes and although I had specifically ordered the pizza cut into slices they cut it into squares.  So yes a whole hour to wait for a pizza.  After all that the pizza wasn't even very good (the sauce has no zing - tastes just like tomato sauce). Bottom line is that I would never go back to this place again.
pos	This place is just so so rad. It was about time that AZ has a high end sneaker boutique.  The selection of sneakers as well as clothes is above all. No kidding. I bought a pair of limited edition Jordans as a gift here. All of the sneakers here a so unique and fun and it really puts the fun in sneaker shopping again.   Sure you can go to finish line and get a pair of sneakers there. And you will see various other people wearing the same ones. If you really want to find funky stuff to express yourself with this is the place. AND to make it even better...they sell for retail! So markups? Not an issue.  Do yourself a favor and check this place out...
neg	BUMMER ? I had high hopes for this place. I actually drove by once a week to check on the construction progress before they opened. Perfect location craft beer outside seating old red brick building atmosphere! I was stoked!   Long story short: I have tried the food and beer here four times over several months and it is not good. And what is with those baby diarrhea green walls and chairs talk about a 100 year old red brick wall buzz kill. Service is really slow and blah. It is like they hire just anybody and then turn them loose without any training.   I may try them again in a year or two. I am really bummed...this place had a lot of potential.
pos	Dr. Jason Kanarish is absolutely amazing.  I am a Physician Assistant in surgery and  appreciated his \"bedside\" manner as well as medical knowledge which was phenomenal.  He spent AMPLE TIME with me and answered EVERY QUESTION I had.  Not to mention he was fantastic with my scared min pin. I cannot recommend him enough.  The staff is also extremely friendly and helpful!
neg	Oh man...where do I start? This had to be the worst dining experience of my life. We show up and it's a 25-minute wait for two. Okay that's normal. But wait you have to stand outside and it was 109 degrees today. They had a canopy set up gee thanks! But how about a glass of water while I wait? Not here! I'm so glad I had a little bit of iced tea left in my cup from AJ's this morning.  So we get seated; get this outside under an enclosed wooden canopy! Who does that to their patrons in Phoenix in the summer? They had misters but they were nowhere near us. They had a fan mounted on the patio roof but it blew right over the top of us and did no good. I think they sell portable evaporative coolers at Home Depot. That would have been nice!  So I'm looking at the menu and trying to decide what I want to eat when I see the waitress bring out an order to a table near us. I'm a bacon freak and I love it extra crispy. The order she brought out had bacon and it was cooked to perfection! Things were starting to look up. When she set the small plate down in front of the little girl I didn't think anything of it. It was an adequate portion...for a nine year old.  We'll return to this in a moment.   So the waitress takes our order and I excuse myself to use the washroom and wash my hands. So I ask where the washroom is thinking it's inside. I was politely told it was located in the back...As in go outside around the back and there you'll see them. As I walk around the corner I suddenly feel as if I'm entering a washroom at a grungy service station. The washrooms weren't clean weren't air conditioned and the urinal didn't flush. Can you see where this is going?  So back to my seat our order arrives and guess what it's the same size as what I had earlier thought was a kid's portion.  I'm so glad it was hot and I wasn't super hungry.  So how was the food? Well the eggs were runny the hash browns were completely overdone on the outside but still raw on the inside and the bacon...well let's just say that a couple of Band-Aids and that pig would be out wallerin' around in the mud again.  I'll admit. I should have done a little research on my part before eating here but I seriously doubt I'll go back. At least Denny's is consistent and has clean bathrooms.  I'll give the place one star because at least they had two cool photos of Marilyn Monroe in the Men's Room.
pos	Just open.  I had the roast beef sandwich and my wife had the turkey and stuffing sandwich.  Both were excellent modern interpretations on classic lunches.  I highly reccommend this place.  P.S.:  iPad driven POS system is way cool.
neg	Absolute garbage. Food isn't there at all cold old and over saturated with bell peppers. Service is nonexistent by both servers and management. This place really gives the Scottsdale quarter and the city of Scottsdale a bad name. Just let it go already and let another restaurant take over.
pos	I don't frequent Tempe too often but when I do I try to get a Tea Infusion run in... everytime I succeed I literally have a grin on my face after every sip.   It's the least strip mall-esque dining option in the whole of Tempe Market place and that is a BIG PLUS in my book. Add to that that they make Boba Smoothies the way I like them... how could I resist?  Case in point: The Pumpkin Chai. Based off the rattlings of fellow yelpers I decided to try the chai and asked if it could be boba-fied (which makes me want to say Boba Fet) and they said \"SURE!\" It was delish but that was summer and now it's winter and so warm sounded yummy but I had never had a hot boba drink before. So I asked them if I could have it with boba and hot and what did they say? \"SURE! But be careful it's hot.\" And oh so YUM!  I think they deserve the taglines \"Have it your way\" and \"Any way you want it\" more than Burger King! Because out of all the Boba places in Metro Phoenix they are the only ones that have never said \"No\" to me before with Boba Juice coming in a close second.... but only because their range of options is less.  Add to that that they have a Boba Smoothie called Carribbean Colada and it is a pretty comparable alternative to my favorite Pineapple Lychee flavor that only the now defunct AZN of Mesa could prepare for me... so with just 2 of their drink options I am in Boba heaven... wonder what else they have in store for me if I ever tire of my usual options and try something different... don't know if I can... I might have to do a gluttonous double order or sip-taste from a friends selection.  But wait... Boba's not all they've got they've got a tea list comparable to that of Cheesecake Factories menu... it is a long one... I've had a blueberry tea strawberry and a coconut one and they were all pretty tasty. I've also had a panini there and it was quite tasty and filling--I took leftovers home.  My only wish is that the space Tea Infusion is housed in was more spacious with lounge seating in addition to table options so one can really settle in and work or chat with friends but heck I'm just happy they're here and serving the valley some tea-tastiness.  I'll tea back REAL SOON!
neg	I live right by Amore so when they opened up I decided to give them a try.  The first time we ordered from Amore we got a pizza.  It was mediocre.  What really struck me was the service.  The young man at the register was outside talking to his friends and texting when I got there.  It took him at least two minutes to come back inside and help me and when he finally did he was rude!  The second time I went in I ordered pizza and wings.  When I got there once again I had to wait for the person working the register to stop chatting on his phone to serve me.  My pizza was ready but they hadn't even started my wings.  I sat and watched them make my wings.  I almost told them to just forget it because they wings looked horrible.  They were pale and they used an already used bowl to coat them in buffalo sauce.  I literally live 2 minutes and when I got home my pizza was cold I was also concerned the wings were undercooked so I cut one open first to check.  I was right!  They were completely raw on the inside.  I had to put them in the oven for at least another 30 minutes and they were still so greasy and terrible I ended up picking off all the chicken meat and feeding it to the dogs!  I must be a glutton for punishment because I tried them a third time and once again had a terrible experience.  I didn't have to wait at the register and this time the cashier was actually friendly.  My husband and I ordered a pizza salad and garlic bread.  When I got home I realized I had never gotten the salad.  I was back there less than 10 minutes of leaving and I told him he had forgotten to give me my salad.  He basically accused me of trying to get a free salad off of him!  He tried to tell me I had never ordered a salad.......At first I thought he was kidding but then I realized he was serious!  We had ordered online so I told him just to check their online order log.  He told me that wasn't possible.  Then I told him to just look at my receipt!  It should be at the top of their garbage can since I watched him throw it away.  He glanced in the garbage bin and told me it wasn't there.  I had my credit card receipt and I showed it to him.  I asked him how it could possibly be that much if I hadn't ordered a pizza bread and salad since the salad was $8.  I had to sit there arguing with him for almost 10 minutes before he'd give me my salad.    If you want to avoid bad food and TERRIBLE service then avoid this place at all costs!!  If you're in the area and really have a pizza craving go to Bashas!  They sell whole pizzas and pizza by the slice and it's actually very good and you'll receive five star+ service.
pos	We purchased a Groupon deal and went and tried this restaurant . The food is excellent and the service is very good . If you are wanting real Texas BBQ then this is the place to go!
neg	I'll keep this short - do NOT sign up for Sprint service while living in Phoenix AZ. They do not plan on rolling out 4G LTE in the Phoenix metro area until late 2013 at the very earliest. 4G is not currently available. 3G service is spotty and slow. Calls drop constantly dead zones everywhere. There is nothing you can do as a customer to get out of your contract after the initial return period either. I had AT&T for nearly ten years before switching to Sprint and I made the switch to save a few bucks a month. Huge mistake. See recent service comparisons in Phoenix here:  http://www.rootmetrics.com/compare-carriers/phoenix/phoenix-october-2012/  http://www.pcmag.com/article2/02817240562200.asp  Once again stay away from Sprint in Phoenix.
pos	As close to a real east coast deli as you'll find west of the Appalachians. Delicious sandwiches egg creams etc. Pricy but kids apparently eat free in summer so we kept it at 5 stars.
neg	A few months ago I wrote a very positive review of this place.  Starting about in September however something very odd and unpleasant happened to Cheuvront.  The lunch service became slow to the point where I thought I'd been forgotten.  Worse the food started to change in unpleasant ways.  Gone were the good ingredients and subtle flavorings.  Suddenly everything was layered on in huge blobs and weighted down with unnecessary spices.  Specifically I'm talking about the lunch pizzas I had for lunch at Cheuvront so many times before.  Last time I went a few weeks ago I suddenly noticed that they used nearly four times the cheese necessary.  Today there was four times the cheese at least two or three times the sauce along with chunks of nearly raw garlic.  Worse the cheese on my pizza was cool and congealed showing that it had been sitting around for a while before the wait staff deigned to bring it to me.  I was embarrassed to have suggested to a colleague that we eat at Cheuvront today.  I don't know what happened to this restaurant but at least the lunch service is a total loss.
pos	We searched our phones for a place to go to have some Ceviche. This restaurant received some good reviews so we drove down from NE Phoenix and were a little skeptical on the location... but our concerns were immediately set at ease once we stepped inside. What a great little place with very friendly staff! We really appreciated the cleanliness too. We ordered the shrimp ceviche shrimp in green sauce and shrimp and broccoli in cream sauce. Everything was outstanding! Even the simple rice and beans were absolutely delicious! And the tortillas  uh-mazin!! Danielle was wonderful and we truly enjoyed her service. We will definitely come back and bring friends next time! Between the two of us we already texted half our friends about this place and we haven't even finished eating yet! RECOMMENDED FOR SURE!!
neg	Have you ever been to a place & walked out feeling like you were ass raped?  well if you're into that you'll love this joint!!!  The food is terrible....but I felt even worse because it was expensive for the shit they gave you.  We got a medium sausage which at any other place is a very small pizza and it was $22 with tax & tip (no drinks...just water).    Don't be fooled by this \"gourmet\" shit either.  The crust is tasteless & the quality just isn't there.  when I compare this to say Oreganos they are not even in the same ball league.  skip this joint....and save your money.
pos	!!!!!!! ***  O M G ......So GOOD  ***   !!!!!!!  My family & I keep coming back to this place. We drive over 10 miles to get our fix. I think it's safe to say that we are officially hooked and when we are jonesin for Tacos Atoyac there better not be anyone or anything standing between us and our Food!  Today we all came aways lickin our chops and yummy in our Tummy. I might not brush my teeth tonight!  Here's what we had:  ~ I had scrambled eggs with chorizo (dry) cheese onions potatoes and Jalapenos. Served with side of refried black beans and spicy rice and a little plate of grilled onions (sweet & tastey) and jalapenos.  ~ The little woman had a Spicy burrito:al  pastor cheese onions jalapenos mayo avocado   ~ The kid had 5 mini carne asada tacos with cheese.
neg	Hello I've been an old customer since they were located on Indian school. I've been going to tandooori times for past 6 to 7 years but never experienced such a bad customer service from restaurant owner. We were waiting by the bar and the table opened up so we move forward to be seated and another customer grabbed the table without asking anyone else. The ppl worked  there couldn't speak up so we ended up getting a table in the corner. At this point we were waiting there for 45 mins. On top of that another server grabs our food and serves another table. Waiter came and apologized and brought our food out 15 mins later. I ordered vegetarian dish and she comes out with non-veg dish. At this point I'm furious and asked for the food to be waived. Our server calls the owner and he said \"I don't serve free food to my own parents\". Denied to give us free food after the whole hoopla and time that was wasted. Me and my husband used to be huge fan and even though my food was served with hair in it once and i let that go BUT this made it all WORST! The owner doesn't know how to treat customer. Do not waste your time and money!!!
pos	I love the owners.  Very friendly and accomodating.  One night we had called after they had closed and were pleasantly surprised when someone answered.  Turns out they were hosting a private party.  They agreed to take our order which made us pretty happy.  I adore their Greek fries.  Olive oil lemon and the perfect amount of fetta.  Been here several times for lunch and always leave happy.  Looking forward to meeting friends here for happy hour.
neg	I asked for a call from the owner.  Never heard from them - apparently they don't care either.  I guess that's why their staff don't care either.
pos	Awesome resort.  I was able to stay there to celebrate a birthday in July and fortunately it wasn't as hot as it usually is.  I am a wimp when it comes to heat but the resort was wonderful even with many things being closed.  The summer is off season for this spot.  We had a great time at the spa and lying by the pool.  Be sure to have your food and drinks served there.  It feels so luxurious.
neg	Can you say Mama Celeste?  This restaurant was so unbelieveably bad I had to whip out my notepad and take notes.  To have the word Chicago anywhere near this menu is downright criminal.  Aside from the frozen grocery store pizza-like cheese (a sprinkle here and there) it had enough salt to melt a Chicago winter's thickest ice covered street in seconds.  I went here today Sept 3rd for a late lunch.  Alright so I'm on vacation in Scottsdale to scout locations for my future home.  I've spent the past 37 years of my life in Chicago eating pizza (thin crust and stuffed) on a weekly basis.  I read about this place all over and so many people (including some deluded dude at the table next to me) kept raving about how \"Chicago\" this pizza is.  Oh my goodness!!!!!!!!!  If this is Chicago pizza kill me now!  this was the worst pizza ever!  I should have known when the waiter guy (a chick appeared later) said in response to our stuffed cheese pizza order \"I don't recommend cheese only\".  He said \"if you get cheese only its gets pockets that don't cook all the way and explode when you cut it\".  Huh?!  He was going on about this detriment when I finally cut him off and explained that I was from Chicago wanted to compare stuffed pizzas never heard of this but was scared so I'll go with the thin crust.  My boyfriend looked puzzled but I flat out told him \"Obviously they don't know what they're doing\".  Don't cook all the way?  Explode when you cut into it?  What?!  I appreciate his warning but wonder if he was just trying to up sell since more ingredients equals more $.  If that was the case his strategy backfired as I went for the thin crust which was cheaper altogether.  As it turns out I must thank him as Oregano's is a restaurant I wouldn't recommend to my worst enemy.  Bad bad bad pizza.  It was actually embarrassing!  As I stated earlier I overheard a neighbor table mentioning how \"Chicago\" this pizza was.  He wasn't from Chicago but had been there and had pizza from there and thought this Oregano's pizza was so good. Embarrassing!  I wanted to set him straight so badly but I didn't.  If this is what Arizonians (is that a word?) think Chicago pizza tastes like I must find a home asap and open a REAL Chicago pizza restaurant.  I'm so embarrassed!  Seriously embarrassed!
pos	In times of big corporations it was nice to find such a warm and friendly coffeehouse in the valley. It is just a great place to hang out set-up your laptop or read a book. I thoroughly enjoyed my Joltachinno a much better version of the Starbucks frappacino which is just too sweet.  We came back another day for lunch and all I can say is yum! I have never had food like this at a coffeehouse. Amazingly for our second time there they recongnized us! WOW!  I am glad that I have found my new hangout when I come to the valley!
neg	Take two shots of penicillin and a tetnus shot after eating/drinking here.  And for god's sake stay out of the bathrooms.  Don't believe me check out the expert reviews on Maricopa.gov restaurant ratings...pretty yuk!
pos	Great food and service. Normally a wait on the weekend but what would you expect.
neg	I've recently moved into the neighborhood and decided to try IHOP today. A big mistake. After I was seated I just waited and waited for someone to take my order. And it's not that they were busy. The place was practically empty. I saw waiters just walking past me avoiding eye contact. They didn't even bother to tell me that someone would be with me shortly or something like that. Customer service anyone?  Finally a waitress came along and I told her that I've been waiting for a long time. She was apologetic and nice and came to check upon me 4-5 times during the meal. But by that time they had totally ruin my Saturday with their pathetic service and \"I don't care\" attitude. None of the people working there looked like they wanted to be there at all.  I'm not going back which is a shame as the place is right next to my apartment.
pos	best coffee in phoenix (so far). experienced and friendly baristas a large sitting area inside nice decorations community conscious promotes local art and artists outdoor sitting area easily accessible location from the light rail and from the portland park neighborhood.   i had a short vanilla cappuccino and the thing that made it the best insofar to my search for phoenix's best espresso was definitely the milk. it was properly steamed microfoam. the shots were right on too.  the milk i've had elsewhere in phoenix doesn't compare. thumbs up to fair trade.
neg	OMG!  We went just for drinks and the sand bag game outside.  A gin and tonic was $10.00!  Four people six drinks later and one sand bag game ...I left there paying $70.00 tip included!!!  Way too much money I wont order from there again:(
pos	this place rules plain and simple  just wish they had a cheaper jukebox
neg	Rude staff slow service.  They wanted me to wait 48 hours for a spring replacement.  I called another company and they came out within 1 hour.  Go anywhere other than Smokey's.
pos	There are certain people in your life that you should have & trust. A good mechanic is high on that list.   I found out about Whitey's Auto through twitter. Many of my friends were communicating with Scott the GM and I started following him too. His tweets were funny authentic and relevant- and not always about auto repair. The most important aspect of his tweets? They're immediate.  At the time I had a warranty through the dealership on my car so I didn't need to go to Whitey's for service. However when I got into a car accident and tweeted about it Scott responded for me to call him and he'd help me out.   Although Whitey's doesn't do body work their neighbor 1st Class Auto Body does. Scott personally walked me over there and made sure they treated me right. He had made me a lifelong customer at that point.   When my boyfriend's truck kept leaking oil and he wasn't getting results at the shop he was taking it to I took him to Whitey's and introduced him to Scott. With one check Scott could tell that the previous shop had NOT done what they had charged my boyfriend for. Scott told him if he didn't mind the leak he could put off the service work as it wasn't something imperative. And he didn't charge him for the assessment.  Recently the belts on my car fell off causing my a/c to go out & lights to come on my dash. My warranty was over but I didn't even hesitate. I just turned right around and took my car to Whitey's. Replacement belts and labor (plus they checked my battery and charged it for me) cost $80 less than it would have at the dealership.   The inexpensive cost along with piece of mind that comes with dealing with a mechanic and shop you can trust make Whitey's irreplaceable. Don't hesitate to take your vehicle there first when you need service!
neg	We were first ones here for lunch...and kids eat free so I figured why not . I ordered forbidden rice w chicken...it arrrives raw! I had to search for a server and she removed the chicken from my plate...again we wait...and wait...it never came before my meal was finished.  Ha to find another server to ask tjey cxl chicken at this point and just bring bill. They tried to ofer it to go! No thanks...wanted it as part of meal...we will not be back.
pos	I would never have picked a museum cafe for lunch even though it is practically in my own backyard but with my friend's endless ravings about their Dreamcatcher Salad I relented.  And I'm glad I did!  It's now become a staple for lunch meetings!  The dining area is bright and cheerful but the outdoor patio is truly a delight on a beautiful day!  It is serene and is surrounded by a plethora of desert plants and a lovely water feature.  The menu is rather short on items but long on freshness and flavor.  Many of the offerings lean towards Southwestern style.  I have found my favorites on the menu in particular the Hummus Veggie Wrap which is filled to the brim in a healthy spinach tortilla with Tepary bean hummus tomatoes roasted red bell pepper grilled red onions pepitas smoked gouda and romaine.  (I've tried to duplicate this wrap at home with underwhelming success!)  Each sandwich comes with the choice of salad or chips. The portions are hearty.  The service is attentive but not intrusive.  An absolutely divine dine!
neg	Noise from other guests running up and down the hall all night.  I booked and prepaid for a room with two beds at www.hilton.com.  When I arrived I was informed that they do not have any rooms in inventory with two beds and that sometimes websites get it wrong.  Although I am able bodied I was given a handicap room with inconveniences like a shower head that wouldn't go higher than 5'.
pos	Pizzeria Bianco: Before and After  Cited as \"the best pizza in America\" in numerous on-line reviews as well as on Good Morning America and as published in Slice of Heaven to most pizza lovers the three to four hour wait for a table is so daunting that they push on to a more open table atmosphere for their pizza experience. But to the true pizza enthusiast Pizzeria Bianco is as much about the experience as it is the food. This place is best known for the owner Chris Bianco hand tossing each and every pizza pie served every Tuesday through Saturday from 5-10 pm for nearly 15 years of which I was one of those fortunate customers. However early 2010 Chris was forced to retire due to illness and turn over the pizza paddle and oven duties to his protégé of 15 years Horatio Hernandez.  My decision to try Pizzeria Bianco for the first time came from a challenge I put upon myself: Find the best food in metropolitan Phoenix. After hearing about Pizzeria Bianco from a friend I made gourmet pizza my first battle in 2009. I knew about the long lines forming an hour or more before the restaurant opened and this beautiful fall day was no exception. I arrived 60 minutes before opening and my date went to Bar Bianco to start us off with a couple of pale ale microbrews while I held our place in line. Seeing that there were only about 20 people ahead of us we assumed we would make the 5:00 seating with no trouble. However just as we were holding a place for the rest of our party so were the 20 or so people ahead of us and when the door opened promptly at 5:00 there were now over 50 people ahead of us. Needless to say we were left waiting another hour since the restaurant seats only about 40 at a time.  When we were seated at 6:00 the four of us started with the homemade mozzarella local tomato and sweet basil starter with extra virgin olive oil drizzled all over as well as homemade crusty bread with a dish of EVOO with a touch of balsamic added. We ordered three pizzas the Sonny Boy providing salami marinara sauce and gaeta olives the Wiseguy a sausage and mozzarella taste explosion and the Marinara with Prosciutto di Parma. All three pizzas were piping hot when they arrived just crisp enough around the edges and loaded with the most amazing flavors your mouth has ever experienced. We left the restaurant without remembering the nearly 3 hour wait and were fully satisfied eager for the next opportunity to drive to 623 Adams in Phoenix for another \"slice of heaven\".  And so after hearing of the departure of Chris from the kitchen curiosity got the best of me. I had to challenge this place and find out if the changing of the guard made any difference in the wait time the food quality or the overall experience I had truly fallen for. April 6 2010 again I ventured down to 623 Adams in Phoenix to see if a Tuesday night or a new head chef had made any difference at all. My date and I arrived at approximately 4:00 pm one hour before the doors would open. We found a line of about 25 people and looked at each other and said almost in unison \"Well the wait hasn't changed\".  Bob trotted off to Bar Bianco to find our pale ale Four Peaks to help pass the time. We caught a glimpse of owner Chris Bianco and I told Bob how I would love to chat with him seeing as I was writing a comparison review I also wanted to find out who was cooking tonight. Bob stalked Chris into Bar Bianco and asked him if he had any time would he be willing to take a picture with me and answer a couple of questions. When Bob returned with another beer and Chris Bianco in tow I was star struck and could barely speak. All I could muster up was \"Are you cooking tonight?\" To which he replied \"No I have Horatio at the oven. I can't cook anymore.\" I explained my evaluative writing topic and he assured me the experience would be the same. We took a picture and off he went back to the bar.  At 6:15pm after 2.25 hours of complete social enjoyment we were called to our seats at the bar. We ordered the same items we had enjoyed last fall with the exception of the Marinara. The overall experience was better for me as I got to enjoy personal time with Chris. As for the meal it was just as amazing as I remembered it from 6 months prior with Chris tossing the pie for every customer. The flavors were exactly as I remembered and the service from the staff was top notch just like the first time. From the wait to the taste it didn't appear that anything had changed!  So what makes for the \"best pizza in America\" and how did Pizzeria Bianco get the tag line? Well my opinion is flavorful ingredients a phenomenal social experience and an owner who lives by what he serves. To Chris Bianco and the Pizzeria Bianco staff you haven't skipped a beat!
neg	First of all Johnny Chu should be ashamed to call himself a chef. He is barely a line cook. As stated in previous reviews he doesn't even taste his own food (which accounts for the wide margin of variety a single dish may have on two different visits).  So I made reservations thinking I may be able to sit at the bar because I arrived 10 minutes early. Wrong. I was ordered to wait outside. Nearly 45 minutes later and a drink at the bar next door I inquired about my table. The girl didn't even look up at me to acknowledge I had said anything. After a minute or so of staring at her while she continued to ignore me she finally said my table was ready. Hmm.  The food is horrible. I fear those of you who enjoy it rather enjoy the \"atmosphere\" and come here to be seen. The food is either completely bland (e.g. my curry which tasted of water with a slight hint of something I couldn't even recognize) or so hot as to mask any possible flavor. By calling themselves \"authentic Asian\" cuisine is just silly. There are so many hole-in-the-wall Asian restaurants that could cook Chu under the table blindfolded.  So the rude nonexistent service the insanely overpriced food and to be seen is what you're paying for. If you enjoy being treated like shit and fed food that I wouldn't feed in a troth for pigs--you may enjoy this place and good for you!
pos	OK ok ok.  I'll have to agree with some of the below reviewers that this place isn't dead-on authentic Mexican food.  That being said I love it!  The place is huge sporting a bakery (said many times before) with unbelievably dirt cheap pastries (not said as many times before) a little carniceria (not as good as Carniceria Sonora) and a huge dining area.    The dining area with all its painted mural glory is so goddamn cool that I find myself wanting to just hang out there for hours watching La Primera Division de Mexico on TV and enjoying a nice $2 Dos Equis.    The food - that's probably the only tougher part.  Keep in mind it's still pretty good but there are better places in the area for getting your Mexican on food wise.  The potato taco is worth getting because it's fairly unique but it came out so soggy that I had to eat it with a fork.  I grabbed a couple of the Yelp-Advertised taquitos as well - keep in mind these are not the Circle K rolling taquitos.  They are literally just smaller tacos but they were damn good.  I guess when it comes down to it I'm an atmosphere buff.  There were so many cool things to check out in this multi-plex and the atmosphere was so warm that I'd love to head back again soon.
neg	I can't say much on there quality of service as I have never been to the place HOWEVER I will comment on their drivers. They are rude and have NO regards for other people they inconvience. I was leaving the local coffee shop in the drive through and right as I started to leave one of their drivers parks his truck right in front making it impossible for me to turn in the direction I needed to go. As the guy got out of his truck I asked if he could move so I could get out he then (smirkingly) intructed me to go in the opposite direction clearly not willing to move his truck. I can understand if he was loading a car or something of the sort and NEEDED to be right there but he wasn't. All I have to say on this is if he wasn't willing to take 5 seconds out of his day to move how much care and consideration do they have on a bigger job? I wouldn't trust them.
pos	Being my first review there is only one place I've always had a 5-star experience. Hoodlum's is the ultimate music/cd/vinyl/DVD/used music store in the Valley. ZIA and Stinkweeds are a distant second in terms of selection price and overall experience.  Steve and Kristian are two of the nicest local business owners I've ever met. They know a ton about music and the local scene. They'll help you find anything you need.  Tucked in the SW corner of Guadalupe and McClintock (next to Traders Joe's) this is a special place to find that CD/DVD you've been waiting to purchase.   They also have a wide selection of used CD's and DVD's to are at bargin prices be sure to check that out too!
neg	While the actual bus and driver they sent to take us on our trip was great working with them was a nightmare. I'd never use them again. They charged my credit card while holding a check for payment and telling me they absolutely would not charge my card on the phone. I didn't find out till a week later when I got my charge card bill and the uncashed returned check. Then nobody would take responsibility as to why it happened and the customer service rep who promised to call me once he found out what happened never did. No attempt to make it right either.
pos	Great groceries and fantastic service keep it up.
neg	Never again. I have to go to Avis because they're one of my company's \"preferred\" vendors but I'll have to make an exception next time. Service was mediocre. However when I got to the car to my surprise it was a tiny little Chevy Aveo which I imagine is an automobile only used for rentals since no one in their right mind would purchase a vehicle like that. If that wasn't bad enough the car wasn't cleaned; filthy inside and out the clock in the car was about 7 hours off there was no power steering and the navigation system kept on falling apart almost causing me to get in an accident every time I took a turn. I'd recommend any other car rental co over Avis.
pos	If you really care about your health and want a sincere doctor who honestly cares about his patients and believes in his practice then this is the doctor for you. I am a 40-year-old woman who couldn't be happier with the care I have received and how I feel after seeing Dr. E for the past year. I recommend Dr. E to all my friends and family and the ones who actually listen have been very happy with their care as well.   In response to Lisa N. it is possible that you are one of the few people who is immune to Botox and similar products which is to no fault of the doctor. I too was extremely unhappy with subsequent treatments given by another doctor only to find out that no amount of the toxin would ever be effective for me because my immune system works too well. Ironic isn't it?   You should always do your homework when looking for a new doctor especially when you know exactly what type of treatment you are seeking. For example if you are simply interested in the HCG diet program instead of overall health and you had been elsewhere for less money then likely that place is a better match for you.   We don't live forever but we can live better while we are here. Take control of your medical care it's your body and therefore your decision. Dr. E at Carefree Health Path is a great place to start your empowering journey to health.
neg	I'm not a fan of fried burgers and I gotta say the burger was weak no flavor to it.  Was as if you bought a package of ground beef put it in a frying pan at home and didn't season it at all.  Best Burger in Jacksonville they advertise?!?  Thanks now I know I don't need to ever visit Jacksonville.  Actually they have signs ALL OVER the place touting themselves . . . ya know you could take down the signs and let the food speak for itself but . . . yeah you can't let the burger speak for itself when the burger sucked.  Let's put up more signs!  The toppings options were awesome.  I can't see myself going back for a burger but the toppings might get me in to try a hot dog
pos	When we first moved to Ocotillo the first thing we did was peruse yelp for the best local eateries. Mikado was one of the first things to splash onto our radar and we had to check it out. Luckily for us Mikado is literally a 2 minute drive from our house. :)  The restaurant is low-key and I like how the lighting is a little dimmer than usual to create a more mellow ambience. The servers are all very attentive and kind which makes the eating experience so much more enjoyable.   So anyway on to the sushi! I adore sushi rolls with some kind of crunch in them which is why I love anything tempura. The Big Shrimp Tempura Roll is my favorite and it could stand alone as a meal because it's so ginormous. They stuff 3 large tempura shrimp in there with avocado and cucumber then drizzle it with eel sauce. LOVE! And while I'm on the subject Mikado has mastered the art of frying up a perfect tempura. Their tempura shrimp is super crispy isn't greasy and always fresh out of the fryer. The Crunch Roll is superb the salad dressing is addictive and the chicken noodle udon soup is delicious. Their prices are great and you still get so much food. How can you go wrong? If you're within a 20 mile radius of Mikado you need to stop by.  Also I can't say this enough: Please support your local businesses! They depend on your patronage!
neg	Very surprised but the margarita pizza had absolutely no taste! Not sure if that is normal for that type of pizza but we didn't taste the sauce the cheese? And did wait by the door for awhile before someone acknowledged us so didn't like that. We came because we had a Groupon coupon but not if we'll come back when we're used to Grimaldi!!
pos	Loves the recent Cezanne show. In fact I've seen it twice in the last week. I need to find out more about who curated the exhibit as it is very fine. The Oriental collection is very nice and soothing.  The Downtown Chamber Group gave a wonderful concert in the great hall on Sunday. I wonderful and unusual program of saxophone and harp. I think it is great to have music in the galleries. I liked the musicians being on a platform. since the room isn't banked one can see the performers. A few things I'm not so crazy about: The great room is this awesome space for large art. Sunday I sat and looked at it for several hours. You know not such great art. I find the Terrill boring and the other pieces uninteresting. The cafe never quite lives up to its promise. My lunch companion barley touched her lunch and the waiter never asked why or offered a box. Enough grousing I love the place and go often.
neg	DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY TIME OR ENERGY COMING HERE.  No.  Seriously.  Stop it.  Don't even think about it.    Okay if you must don't do any of the tours.  It's nothing you really can't figure out on your own and at least then it's free.  The triple-tour (the train the mine tour and funhouse) were $18.  Buying two tours is $16 - so if you want to do all three it sounds like a good deal.    I know nothing about this area.  And I could have given a better tour than these toothless backwards and racist rednecks.  1) The train tour - took them about 5 minutes before they acknowledged I even wanted to buy a ticket.  I'm sorry - can you smell my feminist liberalism from NYC?  2) the train was cute but was not educational at all.  The guy was kind of an asshole and know it all by not telling you anything at all then wanted tips.    3) The mine tour was not fun AT ALL.  The tour guide was terrible and an idiot.  My personal favorite was when he started to slam President Obama.  Look I could give a shit what your political leanings are and you have every right to dislike the president.  But I could give a rat's ass what you think when you voted for Bush twice.  Moving right along he says \"I'll move if he's re-elected.\"  Good luck in Mexico - you hate Mexicans!  And Canada is far more socially liberal.  Like I said good luck but I guarantee in 2017 he'll still be there.  If he's still alive.  Asshole.  By the way that's the only thing I retained on that stupid tour.  Not worth time money or energy.  4) The mystery house was kind of cool I guess but again the guy was a real dickweed.  Is there a dickweed gene in Phoenix that has yet to be identified?  Because there is a HUGE sample set at least in the people I met.  5) Everything else was kind of nondescript.  If you have a lot of time to kill and you're in Phoenix trust me...take the extra two hours total in round trip travel and go to Sedona for better pictures vibes and jeep tours.  Don't do it.    PS I thought a ghost town would be eerier.  I didn't get that feeling at all.  It was kind of hokey and dumb.
pos	I've always been partial to Harkins Theaters because they have the best seats.  I used to say \"You know what would be the best theater?  AMC experience with Harkins seats..\"  Guess what.. AMC Westgate is the birth of the spawn of just that.  I love this place.  It's frigging massive to start with and has everything inside it.  Not to mention an IMAX.  The experience is great and the chairs are super comfortable.  Nothing really more to say that it's a theater.  I do like the new Stubs card that they put out.  Yeah it sucks that you have to pay for it but it's only $12 a  year.  Not bad for all the free stuff you get.  Another cool thing about this theater is the location.  If you are going to grab dinner/lunch before hand ther eis a ton of places to choose from.  Nice work AMC on making a great theater!!  Ohhh big big big heads up.  Be sure to see a movie before Noon or ya get to pay nice big money.   that's probably the draw back.  I'll still give you 5 stars.
neg	Wow what happened?  The place was great the first time around.  The upkeep is horrible.  My booth had a bad stench.  You know that dirty rag smell.  The sushi is such low quality.  The food didn't look fresh at all.  I didn't even want to try the ice cream.  It was so messy.  I don't think I'll be coming back here again.
pos	I attended a UYE (Unofficial Yelp Event) here and I have to say that Haus Murphy's pretty much wowed all 20 or so of us!  It has taken me over a week to get to the review.  I was still reflecting on the German meatloaf red cabbage and Weihenstephaner Hefeweizen.  How do you say \"Damn that was good!\" in German?  I have new found respect for German cuisine thanks to Chef Hoffman (not sure about the spelling there).  The fubar of Yelpers (I am pretty sure that is the correct term for a large gathering of Yelpers) dined on the patio which is a great space.  Service was very good throughout the meal.  There was quite a bit of sharing going on and although I don't remember everything I tried it was all really good.  It was great to see so many friends and meet some new Yelpers like Norm!
neg	I ordered the eggs rancheros. The tortillas were home made but not properly cooked as they were doughy and really thick. My friend had the chicken quesadilla. The chicken was hard as a rock due to being over cooked. The only thing that was good were our mimosas. Do not recommend this place.
pos	I LOVE love LOVE Coffee Bean.  I have been in love with Coffee Bean for years.  I am so bummed out that they are not all over the place like the \"S\" coffee store.    One of my favie drinks are the Pure Cholocate Ice Blended with whip cream and Green Tea Latte.  The service is always friendly perky and fully of sunshine.
neg	Went here to try the place out. Lets just say I will not only never be back but I will be telling the world to avoid this place. We waited for 45mins to be seated. As I stood there and waited I watched the manager seat all of her friends who came in well after us. If your Jewish you will probably love this place because its very apparent you get preferential seating. I finally went and asked why we haven't been seated yet and there were about 8 people AFTER me on the list who were already eating.  After we got seated the waitress seemed in a horrible mood and made a bad experience even worse. The food wasnt horrible but also not good. The people who work here seemed so confused and clueless on how to run a restaurant.   My advice: Go to Mcdonalds and get better service. Also they wont penalize you if your name isn't goldman.
pos	Very good place to eat.. I go here atleast 3 times a week and the owners are very good people they always interact with their customers. I pretty much know the owners and everytime I go there they already know what I want. I highly recommend this place.
neg	USAirways?  I don't think so scooter!  They don't even deserve to have US in their name because first of all it's not about US it's about THEM.  Secondly they are a disgrace and an embarassment to this country.    Where should I start?  I was going a mere 650 air (900 land) miles to Durango CO from San Diego CA with a connecting flight in Phoenix.  After boarding the plane they inform us there is a machanical problem with the auxillary power unit (a common problem on the old POS Airbus planes!!) and they would have to manually start the engines on the ground.  Not sure what this meant I was nervous and frantically googling on my iphone to make sure the plane was safe to fly without it.  Fortunately it was but unfortunately for all of us low passengers waiting to take off we had no air circulation in the cabin until after the plane took off because that's one of the many things the APU does for the plane.  Bump crunch grind bump crunch grind... Those were the sounds the plane was making while they fired up the engines.  I seriously thought I was going to die!  Then once the engines got fired up the plane was making a wierd clicking sound as we taxied on the runway and even as we were taking off.  This really made me nervous.  Everyone was joking that the clicking was the sound of them manually winding the crank up so the plane could take off.    I gotta give props to the pilot he made up for the delays and got us into Phoenix on time but the flight crew was just eh not too friendly they all kinda looked like they hated their jobs.  Everything costs money on this airline it's $2 bucks for water or a soda $7 bucks for a beer or a cocktail.  $5 if you want an aisle or window seat or else they smack you in the middle seat.  By the way that \"choice seat\" fee is per connection so if you want an aisle seat on all of your flights (say you have 3 connections) that's $15 not $5.  Then I paid $15 to check my bag.  So all total my $330 round trip to fly 650 miles ended up costing me $380 but that's not all!  If you act now you'll also have your return flight to San Diego cancelled in Phoenix!  Yes folks they cancelled all flights out of Phoenix to San Diego at 9pm last night because there was fog at the airport in San Diego.  The worst part is that they made us wait for 2 hours before telling us our flight was cancelled.  I could have been half way to San Diego by car.  Then everyone was asking if they can't just fly to Orange County or LAX (Which we heard from other people in the airport did not have any fog) and they abruptly told us no.    So what happens when your US Airways flight gets cancelled?  Nothing!  You get to sleep at the airport all night long and then beg pleed and pray that they can find you a flight out in the morning.  They don't put you up in a hotel they merely offer you a \"discounted negotiated rate at a local hotel\".   They didn't offer to compensate.  They didn't communicate to us what would happen to our bags.    I heard from another guy who talked to the lady at the counter that they told him there were no flights available until tomorrow night which means I would have been flying back to San Diego on New Years eve assuming they didn't get fogged in.  So what did I do?  I rented a car at Hertz total cost was $127.50 (OUCH one way rentals are expensive) but I decided if I'm going to be driving to San Diego at 10pm at night I better have a comfy car so I upgraded to the CTS for $20 more which was well worth it in the grand scheme of things I made record time and was home in bed by 3am on 1 tank of gas (and people diss American cars but I'm here to tell ya 300 horsepower 1 tank of gas 380 miles AMAZING!)...    Now I'm waiting to hear about my bags desperate and afraid of how long it might take.  I'm also hoping they will refund me for my flight but I doubt that's going to happen.  Will update the review after I see how they treat me after the fact.  Needless to say I know flight cancellations in San Diego are rare but I just don't think I can trust my life with this airline ever again with their old worn out planes nickel and diming you to death with fees and hey wait a second isn't gas lower then it's been in 10 years and yet the airlines are still charging us all these fees and higher fares?!
pos	Taste buds went CRRRAAZZYYY!!  Finally made it to the much raved about Pizzeria Bianco and happy I did. It was absolutely delicious. Thankfully we made it at a good time where we didn't have to wait at all for a table (YES!). I ordered the Margherita and was deliciously pleased. However my sister opted for the Biacoverde and boooy was I jealous. It was awesome and my favorite by far.
neg	worst tuna sandwich i've ever had.... and i use \"tuna sandwich\" loosely in that i had to check to make sure there was actually tuna in the damn thing.  i don't eat at subway often but when i do i order the same thing; tuna on italian with the works.    and theirs SUCKED.  i'll never step foot in this subway location again.  who wants to pay 5 dollars for stale bread and a shit ton of lettuce?
pos	Dr. Ford is great.  She came highly recommended and I can see why.  Very focused and caring assessment of my Dog.  Bring your animals here they will be taken care of properly.
neg	If you come here to eat breakfast because an old friend is in town for the day here's some advice; DON'T. Service doesn't even aspire toward bad. In fact the service ranks so far down on the bad scale it can't be measured. I't like that movie...The Abyss. Food was decent but nothing to make your shorts wet.  And you know those dollar sign symbols indicating how pricey the joint?  Well this place should have a small picture of Warren Buffet Bill Gates and Mark Zuckerberg gathered inside  the bullion room at Fort Knox for some kind of ceremonial \"Were rich bitches'  circle jerk prominently displayed somewhere on the menu.  This place not only sucks balls it does so with such tremendous wind tunnel force it swooshes them down whole where they lodge in the back of your throat jamming up your glottal stop preventing you from making the UH-OH sound upon seeing your bill.
pos	Everyone point and laugh at the nerd reviewing a convenience store.  Oh yeah? Stuff it. Like donuts? Check this out.  Get in your car and drive here around 3AM and try their donuts. Had every single donut place in the area and nothing can hold a candle to the QT donuts.   My guy begrudgingly takes me here every couple of weeks for the donut stake out. It's so worth it.   They get hard during the day so seriously - 3AM or bust.
neg	Sprinkles cupcakes is nothing special and it just goes to show marketing is everything. The service is great and the presentation of the cupcakes is nice. When you see the pretty cupcakes in their nice box you really think you are getting a gourmet cupcake like other bakeries. The red velvet cupcake was Just ok. The Carmel apple and cinnamon sugar cupcakes were muffins. They were good but I was expecting a cupcake. The chocolate vanilla with sprinkles was the best but nothing to write home about. There are tons of great bakeries out there with amazing cupcakes. I will never come back here and I hope one day more people see past all the gimics and realize sprinkles is just a fancy store selling over priced regular old cupcakes and muffins.
pos	My daughter and I really love it here.  I always walk in without an appointment and I never have to wait more than a few minutes.  The staff is very friendly talented and professional.  Highly recommended!
neg	I wish there was less than 1 star because now that they don't have flour chips there is no point..... It is just another Mexican restaurant :-( Super bummer.
pos	I am giving Ajo Al's on Shae five stars because I've been there regularly for about two years and it's always good. Now let me point out two issues: I'm not a huge fan of Mexican food and I only get the Tacos Del Mar or Ono Fajitas which are versions of the same thing. The chips are fresh made and great as are the salsa and hot salsa (more peppery and hot). For appetizers the Chili Con Queso Dip and Nachos are good sized and tasty. For a friend and I this location is somewhat out of the way but we still go regularly. Try it.  Detail:  Like I said I'm not exactly a fan of Mexican food. I like the Americanized fast-ish food chains: Qdoba Chipotle even Baja Fresh. I've eaten at actual Mexican restaurants in Mexico and had home cooked Mexican fish tacos and tamales. It's growing on me but these are not tastes I grew up with.  I have a friend who loves Ajo Al's she lived next to it or something. So I pretty much got dragged there about two years ago and I liked it right away. Like I said I've only really eaten the fish tacos but they're the best I've had. The fish is good the sides are good idk what chipotle cream is but it's good good service the chip lady is nice all the wait staff have been good.  It's typically not crowded but sometimes your go there and the place is close to full. I've never waited to be seated though. I've never tried the bar area. The water seams better than tap water...a dumb observation but I usually drink water rather than soda so I mention that. They give you a pitcher of water on seating and refill if needed. The chips and salsa are endless and excellent. Service is always good.  Two friends typically get the Pollo Con Queso and swear it's the best ever. I've had it as left-overs and it's good but not really my thing.  This is the only Ajo Al's I've been to...no comment on the rest of this chain.
neg	20 mins to get service and then another 30 waiting for drinks. Went to the bar to find out what was going on. They finally told us they were looking for the alcohol that goes in the drinks...BS!! Avoid this place like the plague!!!
pos	Wow Chill rocks. Frank and his lovely wife the proprietors are fantastic. The prices are super low and the gelato/sorbet is awesome. While we were there a little kid dropped the top part of his cone on the ground. Frank replaced it for free.   Then he gave us a sample of the fat-free sugar-free chocolate sorbet which made me want to buy a pint of it... after I had already eaten a baby sized Mango/Pomegranate mix. Yum.   How about this: Go have dinner/lunch/breakfast/whatever at Pita Jungle then walk across the parking lot to Chill for dessert. That sounds like the perfect evening.
neg	I wanted to buy the groupon for this place so I read the reviews (despite seeing the 2 stars on yelp). Clearly I am not goin to either buy the groupon now or ever plan to go this place. It seems the management neither cares about the reviews here nor does anything to change that. Plus it pains me to see the correlation between the prices of the items here the quality of food/ambiance offered & the ratings on yelp. I am sorry I am reviewing this place before actually going here but thank you yelp for the warning. Not changing this until I see an improvement though
pos	Ok technically this is not Mexican food it's spanish and puerto rican food but has a lot of the same kinds of spices and is WAY WAY WAY good.  first off they have plaintains which look like bananas but taste like potatoes. if you've never had them try them here yum! this is definitely the place to go with a big group of peole and share a few different dishes. good luck because the menu is HUGE. the dessert menu alone has two dozen items!  seafood like ceviche and paella (supposed to be to die for) tapas tamales soup salads egg dishes (not breakfast)...the list goes on and on and that's just lunch! plates top off around $12 for the most expensive for lunch but you can easily make a meal out of two apps. the mojito is their specialty and they have i think a dozen rums to choose from along with sangria. on the last monday of the month every bottle of spanish wine is half off- you cork it if you don't finish it. i can't give this rest. a more glowing recommendation!
neg	I would not recommend this business. Their bill exchanger is broken with a sign that states \"repairs are not scheduled\". The attendants do not have cash so any bill denomination you insert in their machine will be loaded to a pre-paid card minus $0.50 fee. Those machines also malfunction often causing purchases of new cards when you are only trying to add funds to an existing card. Each card costs $0.50 no refunds. I put the card in my purse and when using it at the dryer got an error: Card Damaged. No one available for balance refund. Must buy new card. The front loaders leak detergent. The attendants do not speak English. Over two visits I lost $2.25 in fees and a malfunctioned card (that balance was lost). There are cleaner cost effective customer servicing laundry facilities in the valley---I suggest you use any of them. Just not this one on Indian School and 7th Ave!
pos	Durants ROCKS.  I love the red velvet walls. I love walking through the kitchen to get to the restaurant. I love the garlicky cheesy bread that probably has a million calories in it. I love the steaks. I love the decor. I love the bar.  We all ordered different items when we went here for dinner one night and all raved about what we had.  I don't think you can go wrong no matter what you order.  It's amazing delicious and very very unique.
neg	WORST USPA EVER!!!!!!  Rude old angry women.  Very slow.  One sat and chatted up with her home girl for like latterly 30 minutes while people were in line.  Im not over exaggerating at all either I had to leave to the Walgreens down the street to by tape (because the USPA charges for clear tape) and when I came back she was still talking to her friend.
pos	I love this place. The Las Vegas roll is amazing however the crispy California roll isn't that crispy. Their sake is in fact bomb and the restaurant it always a good time. Their prices are reasonable for sushi places in Tempe and the service has always been awesome. If you've got a party bigger than 4 though call ahead.
neg	Awful!  Worst dining experience I have had in a long time.  I wish I could give negative stars. -I wanted to look at a menu but the waiter/front of house guy kept pushing the buffet. So we reluctantly gave it a try - I wish we had just left the restaurant.  -food was mediocre at best once you got past the fact that it was dry cold and tasteless  -the ambiance was dreary and the incense was nauseating. -there is also no place to change a diaper  in addition to the fact that the bathroom was not stocked with toilet paper or paper towels and the floors were grimy and sticky GROSS -when it came time to pay I WAS CHARGED $100- no joke!!!!   When I brought it to his attention he acted like I was the one inconveniencing HIM!  Then after completely screwing my finances for the day he had the nerve to get on to me about my card declining when he tried to charge it for the correct $9 amount.  Fully embarrassed and infuriated I had to ask my friend to cover me.  I will NEVER return to this establishment. There are so many other better Thai restaurants in the area I don't even know how or why these people are still in business! DO NOT go here!
pos	Some of the best coffee I've ever had -- and I lived in Portland. Insanely good selection & product. Tanzanian peaberry off the charts. Owner gets beans from multiple sources to ensure that his selection is the best.
neg	Cowboy Ciao...well...no. Yeah you have all heard the hype excellent food etc...! It was medicore at best. We had some small plates just to test the waters at this place. I have been wanting to try it for years and finally we got a chance to go. What a complete disappointment. We had the chopped salad server upsold us from the $6 salad that seemed better IMO. The chopped salad was nice for about 3 bites then it got boring. So boring I could barely taste it after the 4th bite. Not real strong in flavors not enough salt to bring out the flavors very blaaa!  Next we moved on to the mac and cheese. YUK! Absolutely aweful. Dry flavorless with a hint of spice. Boring. No real cheese flavor totally disappointed but ate it anyway. Next we had the dungeness crab enchilada's....boring!! No real taste of crab in the enchilada even though I did have a OK amount in there. All I could taste is the spicy cream sauce poured on top. Very bland never a taste of fresh crab that would have made the enchilada. Not good at all. We did have sampler desert plate (on the house) which was very good. The mousse was great cheesecake was excellent but I was slightly disappointed again in the bread pudding that is so talked about. Not very flavorful little dry and the compote overpowers the bread pudding sorry but vanilla ice cream alone works best. Overall totally disappointed. Will never go back. I have had better....way better for the same price. Service was great though our watress was wonderful.
pos	One of my most favorite coffee shops! Location for sure. Soooo cute here. Inside and out. The patio is beautiful and you feel like you're in a diff city for a moment. Coffee is pretty darn good. Not the best but good. And the menu is great. I am a vegetarian and they have many options for us. The treats are amazing. The staff is amazing. And they always seem to play great music too. Love this place. Wish it were not so far away in Mesa...
neg	Ghetto!  You know I realize we live in Arizona and grass is hard enough to grow in our ridiculously harsh climate and having dogs trample all over it all day makes it even harder.  That being said I have visited many dog parks with grass.  So can someone explain to my why this dog park is 100\% gravel?  I'm not even sure it's all gravel I think there may be some needles and broken glass mixed up in there.  The place is all sorts of hilly with nasty scratchy bushes everywhere.  Our dog Rally did not care for this place at all.  After sniffing the perimeter he came back and laid down next to us.  Also not a good place for people as there is only one bench and very very minimal shade.
pos	I love this restaurant. Very cheap very clean the food is sooo good. My mom and I eat there once every couple of weeks sometimes twice once a week. The staff is very friendly and attentive. The environment is very comforting. I recommend this place to anyone who loves cheap but tasty Mexican food.
neg	Horrible food.
pos	I'm giving this Office Max five stars for convenience friendly service competitively priced products a stocked shelves.   This Office Max is a great in and out shop. On one side there is the detailed supply store and on the office side there is a complete copy center. It's open until 9 on the weekdays and they don't make you feel rushed if you get there at oh let's say...8:50. In fact they are helpful! They walked me around and helped me find the random items I needed. The copy center staff was also very friendly.   This Office Max has your complete supply of office items but their prices are very reasonable! I purchased the same item at another shop that I did here and it was significantly less expensive here.   So on that note I end my review on Office Max but I will report back with any new findings.
neg	With one hell-of-a-layover and starving I decided to stop at the Blue Burrito Grille in the Phoenix International Airport. I had many many choices but this restaurant's friendly and warm ambience lured me in. I sat down to a semi-cleaned table that I had to wipe clean myself. Ok. Bad. But not that bad. I was quickly greeted and offered a drink. Looking over the menu my stomach told me to go with the chicken burrito. I hadn't had mexican food for quite some time and the restaurant was bragging that they were known for their burritos so bonus! Bring it on. The menu read that it came with all the ingredients that you would expect from a super burrito. It was delivered fairy quickly and cut in half which I normally do not prefer. Come on now I'm a big boy now I don't someone cutting my food into smaller pieces anymore. At first glance it looked pretty tasty and then I took a bite. Disappointment set in and if it wasn't for my gross need for nourishment at that point I would sent it back and left. This large burrito had no flavor what-so-ever except for the taste of leftover chicken that has been reheated. There was absolutely no seasoning and one third of the burrito was shredded lettuce. Adding the accompanying hot sauce did no good either. I don't know what to say. I had another bad airport food experience again on this trip. And apparently the people who were sitting two tables away were having their own bad experience as well so bad that they got up and left. In the end SEASON YOUR MEAT! YOUR FOOD! Ambience is nice but food especially mexican usually has great flavor so give it to us. Now that I am home I will be visiting my favorite taco truck in Oakland where I can get a real authentic great tasting burrito.
pos	Tasty Thai- is. But it could also be called Delicious Thai. And the service is always great!
neg	Very poor experience.  Over one hour for food - poor service very expensive - wont be back.  Will go to Deluxe anyday over this joint.  225$ bill for 3 families.  No thanks
pos	If this place only served chips and their salsa bar I would still give it 5 stars!  As a salsa and hot sauce (they're different people!) fanatic I tend to judge Mexican food joints based on their quality of salsa - and La Condesa ranks high!  Last time I was there I counted 10 different salsas and 2 or 3 different condiments (limes onions etc.).  They offer a wide range of salsas from their exotic strawberry salsa to spicy chipotle or creamy cilantro.  It looks a little silly with 8 little cups on salsa at your table but you have to try them all!   The horchata here is also 5-star material.  Don't be a cheapskate - shell out the $4 for it! Its giant it will make you happy. And when you're done with it you can eat the fruit and nuts - the drink keeps on giving!   I have been here twice and have only eaten the veggie tacos 2 of them are enough to fill me up and they are very delicious!  I must say I am not a huge fan of their rice and beans which seem a bit bland to me.  But the tacos salsa and drinks all make up for some plain 'ol rice!   I was very  happy to see a decent sized crowd here on my most recent visit and that La Condesa is applying for a liquor license.  This place needs to stick around for awhile!
neg	Been to this business 5 times now spent $1000 dollars on my car and it still isn't fixed. Terrible customer service. Will not be returning. Might as well go to a dealership because they charge less and will actually fix my car.
pos	Tarbell's is top notch in all areas!  Food quality service ambience amazing!  I recently took ten business associates there for a meeting and I got nothing but compliments the next day on such an excellent choice of restaurant!    Definitely try the Spaghetti & Meatballs as well as the Mac N Cheese and even the Pizzas are to die for.  And the burger too!  You really cant go wrong here.  Warning the deserts here are HUGE (yet amazing).  One desert is enough for 2-3 people!
neg	If a \"Kurt\" picks up the phone or tries to assist you hang up/ leave immediately. Total dick. He convinced me to go in for a new battery quoting me at $75 after taxes and labor (compared to $85 @ auto zone). After he installs it he tries charging $85. I very kindly reminded him of the original quote and conversation and he kept saying \"everyone pays taxes we all pay taxes in this country\" literally at least six times. I could not get in one word edgewise as i tried to remind him that his quote was the price AFTER taxes. Whenever I tried talking he said \"I'm not going to argue with you\" literally six times. Complete asshole. I asked for a manager then he proceeded to begrudgingly give me the discount he originally offered me. Never ever going back to this shop all of my experiences here so far have been very unsatisfactory. Calling in tomorrow to complain about \"Kurt\" (fitting name for a very curt douche).
pos	Amazing cheesesteak.  One mile from my home is Corleone's. About 15-20 minutes from my home is Capriotti's. I never go to Corleone's. I go to Capriotti's all the time.  The workers here are nice and the cheesesteak is terrific. The large is 20\" I believe so if you're ordering for yourself and in no mood to eat until you have a stroke get the medium. Also try it with the hot peppers. It adds the slightest bit of spice without becoming too overwhelming.  That's really all I can say about this place. Wonderful cheesesteak. I haven't tried anything else because the cheesesteak is too good to pass up when I make the drive down there. The patrons rave about the other sandwiches though so I absolutely would not be afraid to try something else. There's maybe 5 or 6 tables inside and 2 outside? so be prepared to order to go if you arrive at prime dine-in lunch/dinner hours.  Do yourself a favor and go to Capriotti's. Help this place attain the reviews and ratings it deserves. The fact that there's only 8 reviews is criminal. I understand it is in the heart of the suburbs but it's worth the drive.
neg	I have lived in this complex since June of 2009.. I chose it because of the descent prices and proximity to work. Generally I would say I have been pleased with living here but the longer I have stayed the more learn and the more I want to move out.   Things I learned after moving in or since: the store owner of the internal 'market' was murdered a couple years back by a tenant.  Within he last year a female tentant was raped mid-day by two indivuals two different instances of tenants dying from drug overdose 11 first floor apartments were broken into in a month and had their flat screen tv stolen  A friend of mine had his computer stolen from his car while parked right in front of a security camera. The front office has not been helpful or concerned about this. Their initial response was that 15 new residents were moving in and they would not get to the tapes... a couple days later they stated corporate would have to review the tapes. It has now been almost three weeks and they still have not contacted me regarding any of this.. I realize theft is a problem every where.. but they clearly don't care about my concerns.   Other (Non-safety) issues:   Pool maintenance.. The pool near my unit was shutdown by the city for the majority of the year last year. All winter the pool was shut down the the point ducks moved in..then in the peak of pool season they finally drained it to re-tile and make repairs.. but the time it was open again pool season was nearly over. Other pools are frequently dirty without operable chairs or the key to enter has been changed.   Lights: Many of the lights around the complex are burned out or broken.. The light by my unit is out it was replaced a couple months back and burned out almost immediately.. I am specifically not calling to report it to see how long it takes for a repair.   Cleanliness: Many of the tenants (myself included) have dogs. There have been periods of time where everywhere I look there seems to be dog poop and all the bags to pick it up are gone. I have also noticed a lot of the tenants toss chicken bones into the grass and bushed around the grills. I have seen trash/dead birds/grass clippings/vomitt left for days at a time.   Oh and if you choose to move in and then wish to leave.. you better save up if you want to break your lease it is going to cost you BIG TIME
pos	I have been exploring more of the park recently.  I want to add that the National Trail (which is almost 15 miles long and goes from one end to the other) is a real gem.  The views on this trail are outstanding and on the western half you will find far fewer people than on the eastern half.  Highly recommended.
neg	This review is not a review of the store but of AT&T wireless service in general.  AT&T is the worst wireless service I've ever had.  I have more dropped calls and less bars in more places than any other carrier I've had and I've had Verizon T-Mobile (the best) and now AT&T.  I would have never switched service if I didn't have to in order to get my iPhone.  And for the record ... the iPhone is the best object I've EVER owned.  I recommend you avoid AT&T wireless at all costs (unless you want the best phone in the world only then is it worth it).
pos	I have been going to Physical Therapy for several weeks working on Plantar Faciatis (ripped tendons in the foot) I was not getting enough massage to make much progress I switched to Massage N You and they focused on my calves and now we are making good progress on healing.  They had the right touch pressure and listened to what I needed.   Going back for more...
neg	I went by this location for lunch today only to see a big CLOSED sign by the entrance.  Other cars came in too so I'm assuming it recently shut down.  I had lunch there 2 weeks ago.  The sign said that the Gilbert location was still open.
pos	Recently bought a house and had issues with the speed and interference with the very many wifi networks around me. I decided to go wired so after I did a lot of research on how to get a wire from my second floor to first floor for the entertainment center. I bought a lot of tools from Fry's electronics and then after I started actually looking at what I had to do I realized it would not be something I can do myself.  I called good guys electric and they came over and ran a couple of wires using CAT6 instead of the CAT5 I would have used through the (nail-ridden) attic and through walls without any wires sticking out while they kept away from the electrical wires to prevent interference.  I returned the tools and wire I got from Fry's electronics and that made the install very affordable.  I'm very happy with the quality of my network speed now being able to stream HD content from my server upstairs to the TV 200 feet away.  After completing the network-wiring job I had them install a new chandelier on a remote-controlled dimmer switch which was done quickly and works great
neg	What the hell happened to this place?  I used to love Chino Bandido... their wacky Mexican/Asian combos seemed to give me consistent mouth-gasms every time I'd go there. Within the past year or so however something changed the staff went way downhill and the resulting food that comes out of the kitchen is a sad and pathetic shadow of what it used to be.   Just to illustrate this point I decided to give this place another shot a few weeks ago and upon walking in (the place was empty by the way) I was greeted with a \"wassup' by the main kid at the register... nothing more than that... just \"wassup\" with a look on his face like I was a rival gang member entering into hostile territory... not very welcoming to say the least.   After ordering my combo dish 'to go'... I was treated to about a 15 minute wait and while I was waiting the three kids working in the kitchen were rapping with each other. Some of the words coming from their mouths are probably too harsh to include in this review. It was obvious that they were paying no attention to my food that was cooking. It was so uncomfortable to be sitting there that long staring at a group of clueless kids making fools out of themselves... I almost walked out without my food even though I had already paid; because let's be honest... the chance of this food being decent at this point was near zero in my mind.   After my long wait and being handed my bad of food by one of the delinquent-looking employees (who by the way didn't mutter a single word when giving me my dish or when I left)... I went home to uncover what horrors awaited me in that styrofoam container. Let me just tell you my friends it was not pretty. It looked like someone had taken an ice cream scooper and just plopped a pile of beans on top of a soggy tortilla and rice... then put in on the floor and stepped on it. It was a mushy pile of greased up nothingness... no substance just a poor excuse for a pile of food that could be mistaken for animal excrement.  By no means should you go here unless they revitalize this place or hire some new staff... so this is your warning; avoid the Chandler location like the plague!
pos	Been here twice. First time to fix a broken window regulator and the second time to get a checkup. All the techs have been extremely honest and I've never felt taken advantage of. I spent over a grand on updates to my car there and I could've spent more but again they're honest and didn't pressure me to do everything that they said. It's family owned & run (they're originally from the bay area so of course I've got a soft spot!) If you have car problems need a check up or need a second opinion they won't steer you wrong (pun intended).
neg	Cafe crapas.  Another mediocre sandwich shop best suited for cheap office catering.
pos	This is like a little sanctuary on the West Side with a few amazing therapists. The LMTs are pretty different from each other so ask some questions before you book. It is so awesome to walk in and be addressed by name and with a smile. The owner is seriously the nicest lady I've seen running a business in a long time.
neg	We got food poisoning from coming here! The wait was long the food average and a night of praying to the porcelain god made this whole thing a terrible experience.
pos	Japanese chefs top notch sashimi affordable neighborhood sushi place! 5/5  I'd lived in Japan before and this place can beat those in Tokyo! If you go to Hiro you have to order their sashimi. We always order scallops sashimi yellow tail salmon toro sashimi and uni (sea urchin)! Their rolls are amazing too. All sashimi comes in a big-fat-lap portion! Very fresh! The service is great too.
neg	I will have to pass!    After many good reviews from friends and other individuals my fiancee and I went here for dinner. The service was incredibly slow (it wasn't a busy night) and the food was nothing to rave about. I got the ribs and it was tough and chewy.   Edit 1/21/2012:  In response to Joanna's comment I thought I'd post my e-mail response to her in further detail of my experience.  I figured the further detail might be helpful to other yelpers as well!   \"The food was adequate I had the ribs which seemed rather tough and chewy.   Typically I am most forgiving when it comes to food and would be happy to return to try another entree; just because I might not enjoy one meal doesn't meant I can't enjoy another. However the deal breaker would have to be the service at the restaurant.  The wait staff took way to long of time to come back (after we requested a moment to look over the menu) we had someone else who worked there passing by to get our waitress.  The wait on our food after our order was a bit long roughly more than 25-30 minutes and our waitress never came back to refill our drinks or checked back on us after we asked for our refill.  When we got our bill our waitress took too long.  In fact my fiancee got up from our table to find anyone to help us pay for the bill. \"
pos	I couldn't wait to get home and yelp this place. Five stars too!  After a (raw chicken) bad experience some 13 years ago I hadn't been to Bandera until tonight. WOW! It was a GREAT experience!!!  We started off with a grilled artichoke which was fabulous!  Both of us had the Texas Hill Country Ribs which came with cole slaw (not your ordinary cole slaw) and the most delish matchstick fries.  Unfortunately I don't eat seeds and nuts (peanuts in the cole slaw...my husband loved it) but the very polite and wonderful server Sarah offered some other sides and I picked the braised red cabbage which came with a little goat cheese on the top which was to die-for delish!! Home made wonderful braised red cabbage!  The entire meal was SUPERB! The service was phenomenal and we were lucky enough to sit by the kitchen and see all of the dishes come out...they all looked YUMMY!  I am so happy that my neighbor suggested Bandera's ribs and will go back frequently as you can tell this place is run as a tight ship. Everyone is polished polite and efficient! The food is an experience in perfection and the service tip top! Next time I'll take some pictures (if I'm not too hungry)...  I don't think it's a shorts and jeans type of place but a dressy/casual type of place if you know what I mean... REALLY EXCELLENT FOOD!
neg	This place is extremely sub par for a place that specializes in tacos. I'm pretty sure that they use canned chicken for their tacos & burritos and London broiled low-grade beef (which they try to pass of as carne asada). All in all I could make their menu at home and have it taste better. The prices are cheap so I guess that you get what you pay for; however I could get a much better tasting burrito at Chipotle or a local Filiberto's type of restaurant for the same price. I've given this place two chances to change my mind and my feelings have only solidified.
pos	Located in the space formerly occupied by LGO's short lived Radio Milano the north side of Campbell has been reincarnated as the Arcadia Room a private dining facility operated by the aforementioned restaurant group.  I dined here recently for the hubby's work dinner. Unlike so many private facilites that feel like a corporate conference room the Arcadia Room is a cool casual restaurant - all to your self.  We had about 60 in our group and had plenty of room to mingle at the sleek bar lining one side of the room or gather by the open kitchen.The weather was blazing hot when we were there but there is even a lovely little patio outdoors for guests.  I think this would be an ideal location for any work or social occasion where you want an intimate atmosphere combined with reputable fare.
neg	So disappointed with babbo.  Our family has been going there since it opened up.  The pizza is amazing and I love the salads.  Unfortunately they only receive one star based on our most recent experience.  We picked up a pizza and brought it home.  When we lifted the pizza lid our pizza was so sad looking.  It looked like someone forgot to add the sauce and we probably had about 3 ounces of cheese sparsely sprinkled on top.  We called babbo and spoke with the manager. He said there was NOTHING he could do unless we drove back to the restaurant.  We live about 25 minutes away and asked if they could mail a credit or credit our debit card.  The answer was no.  So sad.  I love the pizza but can't stand poor customer service especially when I have been a loyal customer.
pos	I love Tasty Kabob!  Their food is always excellent and I try to make it back there whenever I return to the Valley.  I always order their chicken shish kabob entree which comes in a generous portion that includes rice and grilled vegetables.  The chicken is always tender well-marinated and equally well-seasoned.  Their beef shish kabob entree is also very good. Try shaking a little sumac spice onto the rice and meat for some extra flavor or just enjoy it as is.  It's difficult to choose from their list of appetizers and side dishes but their hummus is always creamy and smooth and I love their shirazi salad.  Their spicy beans dish however is by far my personal favorite and I always make sure to order it.  Just as important as the food is the friendly service I encounter whenever I visit.  The couple who own the restaurant always make you feel welcome.  Good food and service that makes you feel at home what more can you ask for?  Simply put Tasty Kabob is one of the best.
neg	We were looking to join a gym recently but when we showed up to talk to someone and get a tour they wanted us to fill out these liability release forms and sign them. Why do we have to divulge all of our personal information including our date of birth and sign a liability release form just to get a tour? We walked out. That seemed like a red flag. A sneaky way to get us on some kind of spam mailing list or something. No Thanks! We went straight to LA Fitness and they were happy to give us a tour right when we walked in.
pos	Dim lighting. Fleet Foxes. Beautiful upstairs seating that almost seems secret. Band of Horses. Benches that are less cushy than you anticipate them to be. The Shins. Black board specials just because they look cool. Beirut. $13 vegetable dishes.   Intimidated yet? Fight through the angst. Once you take your first bite of food all the hullabaloo will be well worth it.  Order the forbidden rice bowl. Tell them to make it vegan (the vegetables are usually cooked in a bit of butter)... after all you're a pseudo-hipster for the evening and it's fantastic. If you're depressed by the idea of black rice as your main carbohydrate the flat breads are taste-gasmic. That crust... the things I'd do for unlimited amounts of that flat bread crust. Top it off with figs and ricotta and there's no way I'm passing up a square or two... or seven. If you're still not sold on the idea of carb-loading the salmon \"superfood\" is delicious and nutritious and who's not into a little super(food)iority now and then?  But on to the main event... the chocolate stout cake + spiced ice cream + espresso ganache was the best chocolate cake I've ever had. It was just so damn... moist. There I said it. Moist. Moist. Moist. Ew. But really yum. If caffeine chocolate and alcohol don't suit your fancy (wimp) the cheesecake in a jar was equally delightful. Cookie crust + strawberry compote + cream + cheesecake. Layered. In a jar. Who thought of that? Someone with adorable thoughts that's who.   And let's be honest you've earned dessert. I mean... you ordered a healthy vegan entree over the french onion cheeseburger right? Right. Of course you did.
neg	CLOSED!!  They owed so many hard working people so much money. I'm thrilled that they got what was coming to them.  Best wishes to the staff that they walked out on.
pos	Yes it is a biker bar.  And it is packed with them at certain times especially weekends.  I don't ride. But if you roll in on a weekday around noon you might not see any and if everyone seems to know everyone it's because they are all friendly local folks. So if you're visiting Cave Creek don't assume the Hells Angels are there looking to kick ass   Most of the \"bikers\" probably drive BMWs during the week.  I stop in at least once a week for a bite.  The food is the best bar food in Cave Creek and the service is awesome. I've been to every bar in town. Harold's  The Chip Toad etc. all are good but The Hideaway is the best.
neg	When I called to ask the hours the owner snapped and said \"Who is this?!\". When I showed up she made us sit in the parking lot in July while she locked up her dog. Then proceeded to tell us that she was gonna kick us out after I told her I was just browsing. Then she told me I would be the last customer ever because she's closing down to turn it into a B-movie screening theater due to people like me who just browse and waste her time. According to another review she said the same thing to someone else over a year ago. My boyfriend asked if her new business would be friendlier (lol) and she said \"No in fact worse.\". Horrible customer service horribly disorganize no wares of interest smelled like dog and mothballs and the owner is rude & insane.
pos	R.T. O'Sullivan's really hit the spot! The service and the atmosphere were outstanding. We were put into the back room which was perfect for our large group of 45 plus. The server kept track of everything even as people moved around and socialized. The food was wonderful.   We will be going back!
neg	Oh boy I was so so excited to try this place.   I guess I should know better than to have my hopes up eh but you live an learn right. So I will spare you the gore like details and sum it all up for you with a line from Billy Madison..\"Don't go Stay as long as you can!\"  Bad food Bad service and I'm outie 5000
pos	I have been going to Nails 101 for a long time and I love them! I had a manicure done there about a month ago and it lasted for 8 days without chipping! Love Nails 101!!!!!!!!
neg	Dear Karim   I was sooo excited to find your place. My BFF's favorite dessert is cobbler and she loves the whole soul food vibe so for her Christmas present it was decided i would treat her to lunch at your restaurant. We planned this before Christmas and your website stated that you were open 11am-2pm and that worked perfectly for us. So on Sunday Jan 3rd we arrived at your place at 1:15pm appetite in tow craving what you had to offer and you know what ? You were closed??? No freakin explanation.. nothing! Your sign even had the audacity to say open \"11am - ??\" Really? WTF kind of crap is that? If you're going to be so casual about your signage why don't you update your website to mirror your lax hours of operation. You completely ruined the day and her Christmas present which we were both looking forward to. We ended up going to Hard Rock satisfied yet still disappointed by the day's events.
pos	I love Fuddruckers because I can put my own toppings on including gooey melty fake cheese!  Also they have frings (a combo of fries and onion rings).  Very tasty.
neg	The staff was nice and accomodating but I really wish that I was informed at booking that they were going to have a fashion show and  a live (extremely loud) band poolside all evening. (Although the band was good )    Unfortunately the whole reason I booked this hotel was so my husband could relax in the pool/spa and that was impossible. We couldn't even relax in our room with all the noise.   Our bedroom window faced the elevator and there wasn't proper window shading available for me to get dressed without an audience. I had to get ready in the cramped bathroom in order to have any privacy and that was uncomfortable.   For the price I was really not impressed. I've stayed in much nicer \"true\" resorts for less money... and had more comfort in cheap hotels that I did here.  Had we been able to access the pool/spa during our stay I would probably have a different opinion of my experience as it is a beautiful feature of the hotel but that feature was taken away from us and I feel ripped off. After this weekend I won't be going back.  .
pos	The food is fantastic the staff is helpful and the atmosphere is comfortable.   The food at El Bravo just tastes better than the food at any other Mexican restaurant I have been to in Phoenix regardless of price. The cheese is amazing!   I love their flour tortilla flautas  crispy beef tacos cheese crisps enchiladas (I could go on and on).   I really can see no reason to go anywhere else in Phoenix for Mexican food.   I highly recommend El Bravo.
neg	How smart does one need to be to look at an order and make sure EVERYTHING is in the bag?? This is the sixth or seventh time I went to this JITB just to get home and find half of my order missing! They were not even busy! I was the only one at the window until I was leaving. Being trained to observe I thought the female window help was looking at me sidewaysI asked myself why?  well I'll tell you. She knew I wasn't going to get my flippin tacos. One of the last things she asked me is if I \"wanted taco sauce\"? that tells me she was expecting them as well and I did pay for them but when she learned the brain dead cook didn't even get them in the fryers she made the call to just send me on my way without them. With 30 minutes of training I could have an 8 year old getting EVERYTHING in the bag! So A couple of \"I'm Sorries\" and \"would you like to come back and get them\" her job was over.  Like I'm going to #1. go out of my way and drive almost 5 miles up and 5 miles back to get what I should have gotten in the first place #2 I drive a silverado 4x4 with the big 5.3 ltr motor it would cost me more in fuel than the tacos not to mention letting my flippin burger get cold while I do this! HOW ABOUT THIS......Instead of \"I'm sorry wold you like to come back\"?Say...\"What is your address I'll have the stupid ass idiot that sent you on your way without your food bring the rest of your order that you paid for right a way! Then we'll see how many time this happens and what kind of repercussion this would bring! You see....It's no sweat off their a$$ if you get your food or not and no manager will ever know so this happens ALL THE TIME  AT THE CUSTOMERS EXPENSE!!!
pos	EXCELLENT CUSTOMER SERVICE!   Even with Happy Hour in full swing and the place full of parched Winkies the service at our large table was spot on. We barely had time to settle our bums and push the silver out to claim our table territory before iced H20 was before us our drink orders were taken . . . and one quick blink of the eye and the \"peacemakers\" were before us!    Now that's what I call HAPPY HOUR!  Bravo Thirsty Lion!
neg	My car had been  totaled I had my settlement and was ready to buy a car.  They had a car I was very interested in and I drove out there on a Friday night.   The receptionist waved her hand and said that the car I was looking for was \"somewhere\" outside and she would help me but needed to find someone to cover the reception area.  I wandered the lot for about 10 minutes and finally found the car I was looking for.  Looked it over and still no one to assist me.  waiting waiting.... Went back inside and the receptionist was chowing down food and told me that she still had to wait before she could help me.  Wow!  How do they sell cars?  Needless to say I went elsewhere and found a great car.
pos	This review has been waiting and waiting for me to get it out there so here goes...  Baiz market reminds me of Chicago. There are so many great Middle Eastern markets back there that I felt spoiled when I came to Phoenix and didn't know of many. If you think of Lee Lee as the goto spot for all of your Asian cooking needs then Baiz is the place to go to for all of your Middle Eastern cooking needs. And with Al Hana (check out my review for that too) right inside to satiate your hunger Baiz is numero uno in my book!   This place is fantastic the food is fantastic the prices are fantastic and being able to grab all the ingredients I need to make homemade baba ganoush while snacking on an amazing kufta sandwich is pretty okay too! =)
neg	The 'Bowl' of soup is literally smaller than the cup of soup!!! Shame!!  Still no wifi???
pos	I recently stayed at the Sheraton for two nights while attending a conference in Phoenix. I was blown away by the services. This is by far the best service I have received while staying at a hotel in recent years. I received a room on the 15 floor. Room was what you expect from Sheraton. The view from the room really sucked!! I got the room with a view of the hotel satellite and communications towers. TV quality was good and room had Starbucks coffee. Room also came with a refrigerator. I would like to see Sheraton move to Nespresso machines. After a long day attending a conference was great to relax at the hotel lobby bar. The desserts are yummy. I didn't get a chance to try the restaurants in the hotel. Hooters and Starbucks are directly across the street. My work colleague used the gym. He said the pool was really nice and gym had everything you need. Next time!!! I would definitely stay here again!!
neg	With a fresh coat of contemporary Bliss attempts to fill the pews of my former favorite Fate. Well Johnny I preferred Fate to Sens and I prefer most anything over my first dinner tonight at Bliss. With a concise menu of mostly comfort food I tried the nachos and my partner the Mac & cheese. Our food arrived within minutes which was a plus. I confess that nachos are my go-to guilty fave as fried tortilla strips and cheese are a delicious combo and hard to turd-up. Unfortunately I am hard pressed to remember worse nachos. The chips were odd more like wonton triangles. The white cheese on the nachos was the same cheese on my partner's Mac & cheese -- a bland pale cheese béchamel. The Mac was okay nothing that competes with Mrs. White or Cheuvronts. I finished less than half of my nachos and the waitress didn't blink an eye as she removed it after I placed my visa card next to the dish signaling my surrender.
pos	This place is still open but the name has been changed to Juba and it is under new ownership. Same spot though and the food has pretty much stayed the same besides a few changes in the menu.   Anyway I absolutely love coming here. My friend Molly is one of the servers and I love her for introducing me to Ethiopian cuisine. It's definitely a very interesting blend of flavors but now I come here about once or twice a week and stuff my face. I recommend trying both the vegan combo and the pita sandwich with chicken or falafel. The coffee drinks are delicious too and since they're made with Ethiopian coffee the taste is very unique.   If you've been hesitant about trying Ethiopian food just get over it and go try the food at Juba. You won't be disappointed!
neg	Terrible service! It took TWO HOURS to have our food served get the bill paid and leave during the lunch hour. My coworker's salad was served with no dressing at all. It took the waiter 10 minutes to bring us a balsamic replacement. Unacceptable.  The food was only so-so - the southwestern spicy burger looked like a frozen patty.
pos	I want to preface this review by saying that I'm close friends with one of the sushi chef's in training so we got a seat right at the sushi bar and really had a great opportunity to chat.  That being said I will review this strictly on the quality of food since we received some deep discounts due to being VIP guests.  (C'mon now you know you all get discounts too when you personally know the staff/chefs so quit your whinin'!)  The quality of the fish was excellent... some of the best sushi I've had in my existence.  The key to getting good sushi is to trust in the chef and ask them what is fresh and what they would suggest (omakase style).    We had a sashimi appetizer platter to start which featured blue fin yellow tail o-toro (yes the good stuff!) and a few other pieces.  Served with fresh wasabi root (not the hydrated green powdery stuff) this appetizer really woke our stomachs and senses.  We had a few different rolls per the chef's suggestion and all were spectacular (including some off the menu rolls).  The kim bap roll was highly recommended and the quality was definitely memorable better than most Korean-mom kim bop rolls I've had in my life.  We asked for ama-ebi (sweet shrimp) which was soft tender and sweet with perfectly fried shrimp head to back.  This was the first time I've had such perfectly made ama-ebi and it's made me want to continue my search in Chicago.  Some tasty mochi desserts a few bottle of sake and all in all it was a very enjoyable night for my compadres and I.    I'm sorry for those that have found a bad experience at Otaku as it sounds like most of it is waitstaff issues... but as a sushi fanatic my advice to you is this:  1.  Don't ask for a table if you're party is smaller than 4... ask for a spot at the sushi counter because that's how sushi is meant to be served.  Getting to know your chef the chef getting to know you having drinks together etc.    2.  Ask the chef what he/she recommends.  Not all fish are equally fresh and the chef will know what's best for the day.  And if you can provide them with your own past experience of what you liked/didn't like they'll likely craft a sushi experience for you that you'll love.  Verdict:  If only Otaku were in Chicago... I might go broke.  Delicious sushi and worth a visit!
neg	Don't get your keys made here - they never work.  3 different times this has happened. Not a fluke.
pos	Stayed here one night while traveling to Phoenix for business.  What a cool hotel!  I've never stayed anywhere like this.  I didn't experience the 50's personally but this place has really kept and captured that essence.  (And yes it's been renovated.  This place was built in the 50's but it's not run down or anything like that.)  The room was nice the pool looked great (never got to go...) the service was impeccable the food at Zuzu was very good.  Old town Scottsdale is right around the corner with great restaurants and bars.  What's not to like?
neg	What a grimy little corner of Mill. I was with a dinner party of graduates and we were dressed formally...whoever chose to come here after Rula Bula must not have anticipated the constant stream of questioners grunting \"hey why you dressed like that? wedding?\"  The topper was being offered a shot by a group of 18-year-old boys to help them out. Sorry I'll stay here with my husband and soberly contemplate the awful logo and--what's that there?--a pole with exposed nails fallen off from a wooden bench. If you dare come here be sure your tetanus is up to date.
pos	This place is so great! I am a nanny and had to bring in a dance outfit to get the straps shorten for the girl I care for. The woman did this for no charge! It was only the second time I went there. She said it would only take her two minutes so no charge. She was super sweet!
neg	Let me preface this by saying the Pizza and service are spectacular five stars for those!  Why am I writing this and only giving one star?   For stupidity!  If the manager gave us a reasonable explanation then you wouldn't see this.  My mother ordered two shots of vodka on the rocks.  She requested two olives in it... Not an unreasonable request.  The bartender came over to the table and said \"we don't have whole olives will sliced be ok?\"  Huh? A bar without whole olives? Perhaps they ran out?  Ok sure my mother said she would try sliced.  Presentation of the drink sucked...it came in a pint glass with the ice way above the vodka no stir stick and the olives? Were in a rocks glass they weren't even queen olives they were small sliced olives like you get on a pizza.  But I am not writing about the presentation of the drink.  We got the bill for our drinks 2-16 inch pizzas a 12 inch pizza a Pazookie and...here it comes 2 olives!  No shit! They charged us for condiments!  We had to ask why as we have never been charged for having a lime in a beer or 5 cherries in my daughters Shirley Temples or olives anywhere in the world! The bartender never mentioned and extra charge for sliced olives. $0.39 each!  Now $6 a shot for vodka not unreasonable even for rail! I am not upset about the $12 drink. The slap in the face is the charge for olives that were not even whole!    So the manager (Carrie?) comes over and gives us some BS story that other places have figured the cost of the olives into their drink prices so that is why we have never ever seen this before anywhere in the world.    Hmmmm how do those places know how many olives we are going to ask for? Or limes or oranges or cherries.  You know I used three squirts of soap and three squares of hand towels when I used their restroom did I go over my limit on those? Think I should go back and have them add it to the bill?   I am only writing this because I was not satisfied with the reason given to me by the manager.  My mother ordered a $12 rail drink (not call) and had to pay for condiments. STUPID!  Dear Mark Russell You have awesome people great food and service however you need not charge for olives in drinks... Kind of stupid. Right?
pos	How can you go wrong with tortillas and pastries in one location?  I honestly don't understand how this little Mexican bakery stays in business  given everything is practically free. My hubby and I bought two empanadas for me (like a little pie or turnover) flan for him a dozen tortillas and 2 red burritos.  I guess you need to get there early because they were out of red tamales at 2 pm on a Friday.    The empanadas were baked just to golden brown and the crust was so flaky and delicious words cannot describe it.  I had lemon and cherry but I wanted to try one of everything.  The red chili in the burritos was mild but very flavorful.  Luckily they are wrapped in foil because I couldn't wait to get home to devour mine.  They could double their prices and I would still come back!  I forgot to mention the bakery is spotless so clean I would eat off the floor if I had to.
neg	I planned my daughter's  7th birthday here.  I set up the party plans with a coordinator at their HQ in Dallas.  Originally planned for 14 people and then changed the number down to 10.    After the bill arrived I spoke with the GM about the over charges (for 14 ppl) and he was such a prick about it. He wouldn't even look at the emails that I had between myself and the party coordinator stating that I was paying for 10 people. There was a lack of communiation between the Dallas people and the Dave & Busters at Desert Ridge.  No one ever confirmed the # before we got going.  This could have been avoided.  I would have had the chance to leave and take my business elsewhere.    The GM completely ruined the day by being such a jerk about it.    I got a call from the assistant GM last night (after he read my poor survey review online)  and he tried to make it right by offering me credit towards their establishment.  Uhhh...I don't think so.  I will never be back.  I have never gotten such bad service from a restaurant manager before.   We were overcharged and I just want the overcharge fees back.  I will happily pay for the rest.   Do not plan your child's birthday party here.  The only reason I came here is because It is the only bowling alley up towards North Scottsdale/Cave Creek where we live.  It is a huge rip off and I will never be back. Be warned.
pos	Exactly what a hole in the wall Pho place should be like! Totally reminds me of LA SF or any authentic Pho place in any multi-cultural city. Congrats Phoenix for not being completely white bred and redneck- must give thanks to center city.  Anyhow portions are large ingredients taste fresh and prices are inexpensive. If you're one of the sheltered folk out here that gets freaked out by rude bums or the lack of decor- stay in the shelter of your HOA tract home or go to the mall.
neg	very small and dirty looking and nearly no parking.  as we were in the mood for soul food and lolo's was closed we read reviews for this place and decided to give it a shot. we called ahead as we are 30 minutes away the young lady on the phone told us that they would be open until 10pm. great we thought. we showed up around 645 pm and there was nobody but a gentleman at the register chatting it up and belly laughing as we stood there awkwardly not being acknowledged. we decided to seat ourselves we sat nearly 5 before the gentleman motioned that the menus were up where he was still on the phone mind you. we sat and looked over the menus still not having been greeted by anyone. 10 minutes or so later a young woman comes out from the back and rudely states that we must leave. we asked why? her response was they were closing in a couple minutes and if we wanted to order we could only choose from their two specials. we mentioned that we spoke to a young woman over the phone and she had stated that they would remain open until 10pm. she replied no nobody said that. we are certain it was her to which we spoke as we even double checked the phone number dialed against the one on their flyers that were at the register. sorry can't review the food may have been great but their hospitality was not. this horrible experience didn't ruin the night as we had great bbq at famous daves instead.
pos	Love love LOVE this place!  Eugenia is a genius!  Macarons = amazing.  Croissants = soft buttery flaky delicious goodness.  Iced mocha is one of the best I have ever had.  My only complaint is that this place is not closer to my house or work but that's probably a good thing because I would weigh 1000 lbs if it was.
neg	Ok now that you are reading based on the one star.... Went for a dinner for four on a Saturday night and... The female bartender who is always there has no personality and is about as customer service oriented as an old shoe. Our waiter: took the males dinner order before the females served salad and had to be asked what happened to our appetizer and he clearly forgot.  The story goes on with forgot drink orders and the delivery of desert to those of us having the prix fix menu and the rest had to ask for a menu and again he was surprised.  So he said \"dessert    Is on me\".  You guessed it desserts were charge on the bill as was a salad price doubled .  This was the second try with the same results in 2011.  So YES it is a land mark and YES it is red walls and old school cool but.... Food is OK and service keeps disappointing ..... For the price I will go elsewhere.
pos	They are the best!  99\% of my pain in my back is gone thanks to Patrick O'Brien and assistant Joshua.  Bonnie Wills
neg	Service was great... The food was not!  Old iced tea; the ranch dressing for the chicken bacon ranch quesadilla must be out at the ranch... Dry dry dry maybe I will try them in a year or so
pos	It's called America's friendliest airport for a reason- it truly embodies world class service to all. I love it here it's clean great places to eat and smiling faces to great you esp at TSA!
neg	I would not recommend this car wash to anyone that has either a tight budget or a good carwash in mind. I'd decided to give this car wash a shot after hearing good things about it and I was sorely disappointed for a number of reasons.  - $11.99 for their most basic wash is fairly high especially considering that a number of other places do a better job for more competitive pricing.  - I was told that my wash would take fifteen minutes. It took them an hour. Honestly I didn't mind the fact that it took them an hour. The fact that they were dishonest about the estimated time is what bothered me.  - They did not wash my car roof. When I took my car back to them to point this out they argued that they'd tried to get the bird droppings off and failed. Upon hearing this I pulled over to their gas tanks and cleaned my roof myself. Most of it came off even without any soap.  So in short don't trust these people. In addition to doing terrible work they're also quite happy to lie to your face. Stay far far away.
pos	What a great surprise stumbling across this bank!  Open 7 days a week with lobby service  I have banked with the Mega Uber Banks and have been nickeled and dimed (literally) with service fees.  I opened both a savings and checking account here.  Since my company does not offer direct deposit the associate told me I would have to have a traditional checking account with service fees.  I'm thinking - here we go again.  But it was one of those think on your feet moments.  Off they went (I'll assume to get approval).   They let me open up a type of checking account that only charges you for check printing - No other fees and pays interest.  In fact if you use a non-MidFirst Bank ATM they will refund you the service fees.  How refreshing with the current state of banking.
neg	Above the door when you enter it says \"you will find truth inside\" and the truth is..... Its awful at kazimierz.  Made reservations for 8 at Peters food spot Cowboy Ciao. Also put down my creditcard to hold a spot for 8 at kazimierz for nye. Dinner was great I dropped a grand on it (overpriced for atmosphere) walked into kazimierz where the owner Peter and the bouncer treated us like we were here to wash the windows. Very very rude owner and bouncer. they lost our name off the list then stuck us in a waiting area by the front and tried to pawn it off as our intended reserved private table. No dice Kaz we are off to another bar... Ps the comped champaign was flat. Big let down. Big attitude.
pos	short leash is awesome! we tried the sample platter and they delivered it to us inside the bar. we were also given an additional sample tray to try for free. everything was delicious and had a very unique take on a common american snack.   I can't wait until they come back!
neg	I have been going to the open-air Saturday market for a while but have never gone into the store. I have always had a pleasant time and the sellers are always friendly and helpful.   In contrast to the friendly merchants outside the grocery store people were not at least not to me and the person I was with. Answering a question seemed like a chore to the girl behind the counter. Then the cashier although superbly pleasant to the person checking out before us did not provide the same to us. We are probably not the kind of customers they like or are used to?  I'll probably continue to go to the open-air Saturday market but definitely skip the store.
pos	Visiting a friend who insisted we come to Carolina's on my first morning in town to get a breakfast burrito To Die For.  She was totally spot-on.  These delicious hand-made tortillas are fantastic!  I wish I could take a bunch back to Seattle with me but since they're freshly-made I'm guessing the lack of preservatives will make that a better idea than reality.  I enjoyed the chorizo egg and potato burrito with plenty of salsa.  I loved the spicy/smooth combo with the sour cream in the burrito.  I hope I get a chance to eat here again before leaving town!
neg	The poor quality of the products alone makes this place not worth it. Processed cheese on a breakfast bagel? Not sure what happened to this egg patty..The bagels taste good but are chewy and too dry on the outside.   Sure it's cheap food but you get what you pay for: A slimy breakfast bagel
pos	I've passed by prestige nails in walmart 100s of times but never really thought of having a pedicure there (even though they are always busy!) As I stared at my feet long overdue for a pedicure I thought it was about time to try them...since walmart rarely let's me down why should the nail salon inside?  To my surprise I got a wonderful pedicure or $23 not too bad this day in age...my to mention it was just as good as going to the more upscale salon just across the street!   I'm glad to be the first to review them they deserve it! Now if only they did facials at walmart and hair I'd be set!
neg	I lost all interest in going here after a big cockroach crawled across our table a little before the nachos were delivered. And yes we still ate after seeing that. I left traumatized.
pos	First hole in one on #3. I'll always love you Vistal.
neg	Shame on Zipps for opposing a new Z Tejas at Bethany Home and 16th St  Afraid of a little competition.
pos	I would typically never write a review for strbucks because it is all the same.  I mean that in the best possible way as i have come to expct a certain level of service and quality.  Starbucks is amazing for kids as my dzughter oly drinks warm milk and so anywhere i see a starbucks i can ge a kids milk.  I have had  great serive at this location.  Since i could not find the starbucks at the asu bookstore location i am using this review too but really the five stars is for this location. I wanted to give the asu location one star.  My barista NOEl today was exceptionaaly rude. She did not know how to make nor ring up a kids drink and when it  came up wrong instead of offering to fix it told me that  is how it is done.  If my other experiences weren t so good with starbucks i would have switched over to petes.  If you happen to be the starbucks manager at the asu bookstore location too NOEL definitely could use some more training in both drink preparation and customer service.  Sorry for the spelling areas but i am typing on my iphone and havent found the pellchck option yet.
neg	I know this place is overrated crap. I have tried 3 times to eat here but just cannot wait that long for a fucking pizza. I seriously doubt it is worth the wait. Even when it was DEAD it was still 45 min. FUCK YOU! I have had great pizza in my life in NY SF CHICAGO LA and San Diego. Hell there is even good pizza in Phx. Why this place gets all the love is beyond me. The staff is snotty too. I have no desire to eat here ever! The pizza looked OK while I was waiting. But Pizza is simple if you know what your doing you can make as good or better than this joint....hint: Grazie's !!! No wait. FUCK this joint. they can suck it. I refuse to be a loser waiting 12-4 hours for a fucking pizza! Just stupid!!!
pos	The place was just your typical stable but my wife and I had a wonderful experience here. It was our first time riding so the staff took great care to show us how to mount and maneuver the horses. We then followed a guide through an orchard for an hour's ride (just the right length of time for us as beginners). The horses were very tame and were easy to ride. The best part of the experience however was our interaction with the staff. They couldn't have been more friendly and more helpful. We're excited to go back.
neg	This Lenny's location is horrible. The fries appeared to have been sitting in old grease or just old. I asked if they were fresh and she indicated yes.  They were horrible. Will never eat at 5713 w. Glendale location again.  They are NOT like the other locations.. Please mark my words. They don't even deserve 1 star.  They didn't even get order correct to begin with. Had to return burger.
pos	As a sissy vegetarian I feel compelled to mention the soup that no one has yet mentioned at Da Vang - THE TAMARIND BASED SOUP HOT POT IS AMAZING!  I don't know if they use any other animal broth in it because I am willfully ignorant of such matters.  Regardless if you are a meat eater or a vegetarian try the tamarind soup and bring friends.  It is super yummy.  They also have a rice-based soup.  And if you talk to your server they can likely recommend some vegetarian/tofu based dishes that will be wonderful.  Everything else is as good as everyone says it is.  Wouldn't be surprised if people got an occasional bowl of sub-par pho; every family restaurant makes mistakes.  I'd recommend everyone try it again.
neg	was not very impressed with our visit with one of the doctors at this clinic. the front desk staff was friendly and welcoming but our experience with the doctor wasn't great. she didn't introduce herself when she came into the exam room and didn't ask my name no handshake nothing. it seemed that she guessed at a diagnosis for our dog's injury. didn't seem too interested in finding the REAL problem. she suggested very pricey treatment for the guessed diagnosis. went to a different vet today for a second opinion and the exam was much more thorough. MUCH more thorough. the diagnosis today was completely different than the diagnosis given from Desert Hills and it wasn't a guess. the vet i went to for the second opinion spent enough time with my dog to make a proper diagnosis. he also found a problem with my dog's hind leg - which was examined by the Desert Hills Doctor who didn't mention any problem. wouldn't recommend this place.
pos	I totally agree with L.C.'s review.  Going to XCP made college seem like a breeze.  Yes there were the typical high school dramatics but I feel like the teachers were able to take a harder line on discipline since they weren't in fear of getting in hot water with the public school district.  I had an overall great experience here and I love meeting people all over the country that have gone to Xavier.  My last flight home the person in the seat next to me went there and we had tons of people/things to chat about.  It's fun to see where everyone has ended up and it is fun to get together with fellow alums for drinks here in Chicago and when I am back home in AZ.  I think it is so sad that the girls don't get to do freshman swimming sophomore dances or go to dockers anymore - those were some defining moments of my XCP career.  I don't know much about other private schools cropping up in the growing valley but if I had kids they would be headed to Xavier and Brophy!
neg	So sad I have to give this local establishment 1 star; but after 3 attempts to enjoy a meal there I JUST CAN'T DO IT CAPTAIN! We arrived for a late lunch at 3:30pm and were pleasantly surprised at Happy Hour in the middle of the day!   First off...it smells like you just walked into the men's room in mexico when you first enter from the Central Avenue entrance; then it lingers making its way to the bar thinning out with each step until you get to a point where you just get used to it arriving at the bar. My sister wanted to leave immediately but it was the only place big enough downtown Phoenix to bring my bike inside so we toughed it out-again. I torture myself only because I really want to give the downtown establishments a chance!  However the food killed it for me this time. We ordered appetizers for 3. The homemade salsa with chips and a side of sour cream shouldn't be that hard to do. They won me half way with this because turns out the chips are homemade-and delicious! but the salsa is pace picante. If i'd a known that I would have ordered something else. The potato skins came out looking as if they were made previously then left sitting around for 5 hours then re-cooked bacon and all! They were dry and crumbly as heck and the ranch dressing was straight out of the bottle (the horribly tasting one). The Salad was ok but the ranch made it worse.  My  friend who was visiting from Texas enjoyed her French Toast so therein lies the 1 star=breakfast at lunch time yay. It looked okay. Nothing to rave about though.  Since it had been almost 2 years since we all seen each other=a shot was in order! 3 raspberry kamikazi's please.....What? You don't know how to make a Rasp Kami? What a waste of a full bar. Luckily I knew the ingredients and the measurements; but funny thing is the bartender who said she didn't know how to make the drink kept insisting there was soda water. Even after explaining the recipe she added soda water=WTF?  I have seen crowds waiting to see the Murder Mystery Theater productions held there but i'm not sure if I could stand the smell that long! I have to regrettably say this will be my last attempt @_@
pos	I've been going here for 10 years. My relationship began when I needed a bunch of clothes tailored for my first trip to Europe. I needed everything quickly and was very specific. She got everything done in time for my trip.   Over the years I've brought dozens of clothes. She's done everything from changing a dress into a top to adding bra pads to a cocktail dress. She's hemmed and taken in. She's shortened straps and helped me change out fabric in clothing to create a completely different look. I can communicate anything I want and she'll have it done exactly the way I envisioned it. We've been able to change things so much we sometimes recreate new looks.   Her prices are a little high but well worth the quality. Every single person I've recommended has been extremely pleased with her work.
neg	Lets make this simple - If you can mess up a simple banana milk shake (something even I he who burns water can make) you deserve no stars. And since yelp is kind enough to you and wont let me do that let me give you whats next. Your saving grace the lady at the counter was sweet and tried to do her best.
pos	Can't say enough about this place. We were amazed by the room and it's stylings and even more amazed with the pool and the view from it. We were on a mission to chill and found the perfect place. Views of Camelback Mountain and a staff that knew what they were doing. Try the brie quesadillas and the Sanctuary lemonade.
neg	I had purchased the Groupon for the Phoenix location as a treat for my birthday trip to Arizona. I had heard great things about the experience so I was very much looking forward to treating myself! However when I called to make an appointment the call center staff was rude and impatient once I informed them I had a Groupon. They told me I was unable to use it during the one day I had available in town. When I asked if it was possible to make any sort of arrangement she cut me off and told me no and that if she even tried she would get in trouble. She then asked me if I wanted to book the appointment and pay for it without the Groupon--I understand her wanting to try to \"make the sale\" but I felt it somewhat inappropriate to ask someone who has already paid for a voucher ($20) to make an appointment with a payment of another $45 plus tip. Needless to say the guest service is severely lacking and I don't know that I'd be willing to give DryBar another chance.
pos	Always a marvelous experience. The patio area is simply lovely if the weather is permitting. The menus are always excellent and they have an excellent staff. The cheese plate is always great to start and the servers will help you pick a good selection of cheeses and suggest very good wines. The food is always very good and also unique -- rabbit is one of my favourite proteins they prepare here. I have been there for Valentine's Day and also for our wedding anniversary and the always make the evening special. It is pricey but worth every penny you pay.
neg	I came here a few days ago with the wife. We had gone to them when they were in Buckeye and it WAS awesome. Our experience this time was less than stellar.  The dough tasted like play-dough....salty as hell undercooked and kinda slimy/sludgy in the middle.The toppings (wife had cinnamon and I had green chili chicken) and the mild salsa were the only reasons I could eat a few bites. I ended up scraping it off and throwing out the fry bread. The price was about avg but still not worth the taste. I dont think we will try it again. Sad day.
pos	I just stopped in tonight after the gym I was a bit stinky and what better way to fix that than 16 bars of soap.  It was late 8:15 when I walked in :15 before close. This is a great time to shop when you are in a rush. It was empty and the lines were short.  Despite benign the end of a long day the low turnover staff was great and personally recognized me and greeted me.
neg	This place is just plain nasty. I tried it once and it was so bad that I took a couple bites and threw it out. Fast forward a year or so- I was in the hood in a hurry for lunch and craving Japanese but needed something quick so thought I would give it another try. Nope bad idea. Got it to go went back to the office took a bite and in the trash it went again. I lived in Japan for years and travel there frequently still. I don't expect this to be up to the standards of what I could get there but I've had school cafeteria Japanese food that certainly beat this.
pos	This place is so good! I have eaten almost everything on the menu. It is not the fanciest of places but it is great to go with friends and buy a ton of delicious food for very little money. I would recommend this place I go often.
neg	This is Vietnamese food for North Scottsdale white folks who have never had Vietnamese food before.  It's a fast food style place that gives you food with very little flavor and tells you to start adding sriracha and oyster sauce util it starts to taste good.  Really really bad.
pos	The new location is big open and a bit more like a dinner spot rather than a mish-mosh diner. But that's just aesthetics I realize.  The food is great. I had the pad thai and tried one of the duck dishes. I'm not a huge fan of duck but this was nice and tender and the sauce was amazing. Whatever sauce it had on it was composed of peppers mushrooms and ground pork if that helps you find it on the menu. The drunken dragon is also fabulous and at $7 for lunch and $10 for dinner Yupha's a steal. I just finished the other half of my pad thai a minute ago. Yum.  I think it's my favorite Thai in the greater campus area but then I thought about it and isn't most of the good food in the Phoenix area in the Tempe area? I think so.   Anyway Yupha is one cool lady and you can tell they're trying hard with this grand opening. A little ass-kissing is nice but then again places like these are for regulars so I guess they don't have to be overly nice to me. I'm just here to grub.  EAT HERE. And ask for twice the spicy you would normally. The medium is not spicy and the thai hot is medium.
neg	Worst burritos I've ever had not only was the service slow but the burrito had small ingredients mixed in that weren't even supposed to be there. I got a California burrito asked for guacamole which they did not include and tucked into the fold of the awful tortilla was fried egg...what the hell are these people doing?  The whole thing was a runny mess of beans and almost no other ingredients. The cashier was extremely rude the meat was sub-par and I'm pretty sure the chips were radioactive.   All in all I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone and if you're saying this is the best Mexican place you clearly haven't been anywhere other than Del Taco or some other crap fast food chain.
pos	This place is too freaking cute!!!  The OJ is literally one of the best glasses I've ever had.  I had the typical eggs bacon and toast and it was amazing.  The bacon was crispy without being burnt the toast had just the right level of buttery goodness and the eggs were folded such as a crepe and fluffy goodness.  I also tried a bite of the pulled pork burger which was amazing and the touch of apple put it over the top.  Another plus was the garden patio area that feels homey like someones backyard.  I will definitely be back to this cozy establishment!
neg	Is there a NO STAR rating?  30 minutes 20 dollars car came out clean on the outside just as dirty on the inside.  When I asked them to clean the inside since I paid for it they did it pathetically again.  I just went home and cleaned it myself.  I also enjoyed the guy's swastika tat great place for the kids.
pos	This is a great relaxing spot to stop for breakfast. The food is always amazing and the atmosphere is something that will send you into the right mood to enjoy the rest of your day. I wish there where more spots like this on the civic center park it's such a great location.
neg	I'm a transplanted Texas girl from Austin. I was craving a taste of home and saw reviews for this place. The atmosphere is great the waitress was amusingly surly. Sadly the food was terrible. I don't understand actually having a disclaimer on your menu that you don't season your meat?! However that would explain the ridiculous amount of condiments at the table. I ordered the chicken fried steak and was saaaaaadddly disappointed. It is NOT authentic to not season this dish. It literally tasted like a cube steak dipped in a flour/water paste then deep fried. No self-respecting Texan would do this and you certainly wouldn't add pepporcini pepper sauce or Cholula sauce to a real CFS!  The meat was not the only thing unseasoned the chicken tenders potatoes biscuits and pretty much everything else was tasteless and so bad I couldn't eat it and I LOOOOVE anything fried so this is pretty bad. We actually felt kind of bad for them when they saw how much food was on the table and we didn't want a take home box.     I advise they add salt & pepper at the least.
pos	I found this restaurant when they were located in Buckeye. I have tried everything on the menu probably more than once and have never been disappointed. My favorite is the Red-Chili Frybread with cheese added. The service is excellent there. You always get treated friendly and with a smile!
neg	worst customer service and the manager was not so friendly. It used to be better when Boca7 was opened back then.
pos	Unfortunately my birthday always falls right around Mother's Day.  Which means that every time I want to go out to eat for my birthday it is packed.  We thought we'd celebrate early by going on Saturday but it was still packed.  We called ahead and the earliest reservation was 9 PM but the person on the phone said that if we just came down they would fit us in.  So we sat at the bar for maybe 20 minutes (IN YOUR FACE CHAIN RESTAURANTS!!!) and our beers came with a small appetizer of cheese and salami.  These people think of everything. And the wait staff is pretty damn attentive.  The hostess heard me say something about my birthday which was passed on to the waitress so my super huge and yummy meal ended with a delicious dessert of my choosing.    The bread and relish tray would have been more than enough of an appetizer for me but my partners in crime also wanted the spinach artichoke dip which was soooo tasty.  My steak was SOFT but cooked exactly how I like it.  These are true professionals.  Asparagus was cooked perfectly.  The chicken pot pie soup was exactly what I expected and so yummy.  And the dessert?  Triple creme brulee - kahlua which tasted like a caucasian chocolate which managed to be super chocolately but not too rich and a mixed berry that would have been fabulous if I was a normal rasberry eating human.  Yes it's a little pricey but you easily get 2 meals if not more out of one dish.  Especially with the yummy bread and relish tray that is also presented before the meal.  The atmosphere is cozy and a little crowded.  If you are wierd about personal space this is probably not the place to go.  Overall: I love this place and go every time I get the opportunity.
neg	I find the apology from the owner a little different than the e-mail he actually sent me on march 5th. I'll let you decide... Hi Teddy  rick s. has sent you a message on Yelp:  Your Review  \"Teddy I do appreciate your feedback however there are 3 sides to every story yours ours and the truth..Yoli explained the situation to me as it escalated after she came out to talk to you and your friend.. I do agree that our server was inappropriate with the comment she made referring to you and your friend being Loud and Making a Scene in Public nothing to do with being gay how would she even know? Yoli says that your friend repeatedly told her you waited 10 mins not 15..Maybe the wait was to long for your taste since you were really hungry. It was a beautiful morning and enjoying the patio and the beautiful garden it what people do. Possibly taking the other tables order was an oversight You stated that since you waited to long you were going to leave and not pay your bill for the coffee that Teddy is theft and you would never do that if you where in a store and the line was too long so you just walk out with a drink right? The server more than wanted to accommodate you after you made a fuss including my wife. Regardless if there were 3 tables or 30 tables full learn to have patience. Yoli was busy in the kitchen helping make 2 large to-go orders many things you don't know happen in a restaurant. We both have Family and Friends that are part of the LGBT community and we nor our employees would ever discriminate against anyone. The whole new level of 2nd class citizen was really Amplified by your friend calling my wife a Wetback which you failed to mention in your review. He should be ashamed of his actions. We care about and even love our customers which you could still be as we invite you and your friend back for breakfast or lunch and we both can make some apologies and have a better day. Please respond when you have had time to read this and maybe cool off. Thanks Rick and Yoli\"
pos	We were here on Wednesday 12/21/11. We had been at a Rubios in CA recently and was extremely disappointed. Not this time!  Jacob was our order taker and was VERY courteous and professional.   My husband got two fish tacos that were a good size and yummie. I went with the grilled veggie burrito and man it was huge and tasty!  This is what Rubios is about!
neg	Please go somewhere else Overpriced
pos	This place is the best place I've found so far for sushi in the Phoenix area.  The wait staff is always attentive the sushi isn't overpriced and  their specialty sushis are actually good.  They stick to the basics and don't veer too much into the west for their ideas.  The plates and silverware are clean which is more than I was able to say at a different place I'd tried.  The sushi prices are similar to other places I've seen - except you get 3 pieces not 2.  They don't stick too much rice in the rolls.  The pieces can sometimes push the limit but most are manageable.  All in all this is a great place that I will come back to time and again.
neg	WORST SERVICE EVER.  Slow would be a compliment!!!  And the managment doesn't care.    Oh and the food sucks and the coffee tastes like water. Avoid...
pos	This company is Awesome!!! I was recommended to go here by a friend and was hesitant since it was my first time going to a salon. I was extremely impressed with how welcoming they are and how dedicated they are to making your experience unforgettable. They gave me a facial massage treatment thing that was out of this world. The entire day I walked around with my face forward and could not stop talking about how great I felt. I will be visiting quite often. Thank you so much! John Paul D.
neg	Nice-looking building from the outside w/ beautiful views of one of the man-made lakes nearby.  I really enjoyed the walks I took in the park that this branch is located in.  Using the library though is another story.  In the times I've visited this location was either closed or full of noisy children and pre-teens who ran in and out of its doors unattended and people of all ages who talked loudly on their cellphones.  The computer section was always crowded and I could never find a seat to use or an empty table void of backpacks and other items left there by their absentee owners.  I'd say that for the most part this library looked and sounded more like a coffee shop (there's a section where you can purchase coffee and some pastries) than a quiet library where one may hope to do some productive work.  There was a good-sized selection of CDs DVDs and books-on-DVDs which I used a couple of times that allowed you to place holds on-site and online and this service was fairly prompt at notifying me of the availability for pick-up but I quit using the services when my hands and anything that the items touched started to smell of body odor from the previous users that handled them!  (I think that many of the handlers carried the items under their armpits as they walked back to the library which I'm sure we've all done before w/ books and other items but think about it-- we do live in the middle of the desert and bodies do get hot and sweaty...)  No matter how many times I wiped the items down w/ sanitizing cloths and washed my hands w/ soap AND sanitized them the odor wouldn't disappear!  Utterly disgusting and I'm not exaggerating!  Don't believe me?  Pick up a DVD or book on your next visit and take a whiff...  Don't say I didn't warn you!!  Come for the relaxing/energizing walks and views around the lakes.  There's even a playground or two on the other end of the park for children to play in and many picnic areas w/ grills and tables to use.   You can even go fishing!  [Just don't expect to eat what you catch though-- the lakes are contaminated w/ toxins and algae (there are signs) and I've seen more than a few floaters and dead small animals bobbing in the water.]  If you plan to walk all of the paths make sure you have a friend or two accompanying you esp. around sunset bec. there's a specific location that only has one entry and exit which could become dangerous-- if someone's stalking or following you w/ malicious intent well you're S.O.L.    I hope your experiences at this library turn out better than mine!
pos	This place does it right but hold on to your walet! U have to try the Yellow butter cake its over the top.
neg	I don't even know where to begin...  We came in on Wednesday and really enjoyed our food and service.  We enjoyed it so much that we decided to return last night (Sunday).  It was clearly busier than it had been during the day however the experience was not what we had hoped for.  We checked in with the hostesses and were told the wait would be 15-35 minutes.  We decided to put our name on the list and grab a drink at the bar.  They don't have pagers so we wanted to stick near by in hopes a table would open up.  It took nearly 10 minutes for the bartenders to notice us at the end of the bar waiting to order a drink.  I will say we all enjoyed our margaritas but the wait was a little much.  As we finished up our drinks we realized we had been waiting for 45 minutes at this point.  Checked with the hostess stand and they said another 10-15 minutes.  Waiting.. waiting.. waiting.. another 25 minutes went by and then we were seated.  We were surprised because we noticed multiple vacant tables where we were seated and wondered why we had not been seated sooner knowing we could have been in and out by this point.  We first thought perhaps they were all reserved?  But we did not see anyone sit at any of these at any point.  We started off with the guacamole and then ordered our entrees.  Our server returned quite some time after we had ordered our entrees and let us know one of the items we had ordered had been 86'd for the night.  We wondered why it not only took him this long to let us know but why our entree orders were being put in after so much time had elapsed at this point.. There were three people at our table and one persons order came out first.  The server was apologetic but she finished her entire meal before mine and the other persons came out.  The timing could not have been more off.  The food was not as great as the first time and neither was our experience.  Our server was kind but full of excuses.  Two of us at the table work in a restaurant and understand things happen and problems do occur.  However we both felt it could have been handled much better.  We won't be rushing back here anytime soon if at all.
pos	Amazing selection of beers with great tabs educating you on them and often ratings.  Wine and booze selections are great too.  Killer store like candyland for adults.  Prices are excellent and so is service if you need help finding something.  Great place!
neg	If you don't mind waiting in line and then having car after car behind you go into the wash before you you'll be fine.  They appear to be group of unhappy workers that  are actually trying to undermined the process and intentionally make customers mad.  Unfortunately I have a prepaid card so I've gotten to experience this a dozen times.   It's unpleasant to pay $15 for a wash and always leave ticked off or to constantly tell them no others were here way before me!  Fair is fair and their management needs to get out front and correct this problem.
pos	Just have to rave about Becca and Todd's Zoo tour on a Segway. It was the highlight of our trip to Scottsdale.  I had never been on a Segway before but it was so easy and Becca taught me all the tricks.  We never would have visited the Phoenix Zoo if it was not for the Segway tour.  It was fun easy and worth every penny.
neg	Less than zero - closes too early for a frequent traveler.
pos	Fabulous! This was my son- in -laws Restaurant Week choice and an excellent one. Lots of menu choices a drink included and excellent service from the moment we arrived until we left. We will return soon and often.
neg	With the internet as big as it is now how is Gamestop still even in business? If you want to get ripped off on your trades/purchases on new/used games then go ahead and come here. It's Scottsdale! Anything goes!
pos	Oh Rhythm Room how I adore thee!  I have seen some of the greatest Blues legends play here and have never been disappointed.   Whenever The Rhythm Room All-stars play I definitely try to make it.  They are rockin'.    I dig the dancing the bbq (mmmmmm)  and I enjoy when the f*ck the police guy is roller skating on the dance floor!  I do recommend getting there early if you want a table and a chair.  For bands I really want to see I get there before they open get in line get a table then someone in my party goes to grab us some bbq and we start drinking and eating and waiting for the music to start!    I always have a great time here!  And now that you can't smoke it's even better!
neg	Although I am impressed with the herb store that is part of this establishment the restaurant leaves a lot to be desired.  Let's start with the tables & chairs:  very tiny (like for children's tea parties) and rickety (although it adds to a sense of excitement and paranoia -- to compliment the sense of inferiority they attempt to engender with their \"we will wait on you when we feel like it because we are more elightened about veganism than you\" treatment).    A few of the items that interested my husband on the menu happened to be unavailable and apparently this is not ucommon at Chakra 4 according to some other reviews here.  I ordered the watermelon gespacho (sp?) which was very good.  Their bread / toast is another matter.  It was very hard (think thin patio paver).  Although it was drenched in olive oil I broke the corner of my lower left tooth completely off (I think I must have swallowed it) when biting into it.  Since I didn't realize it until about an hour after leaving the restaurant  they would not refund the meal or offer to pay my resulting dental bill.  They have a very limited and uncooperative refund policy when it comes to having issues with their food.  I think the only way they would have refunded the meal was if I were accompanied by a camera team who filmed the entire meal and the broken tooth incident as well as a forensic team who could analyze the contents of my stomach/bowels for the tooth chip and a cement engineer to test the hardness of their bread/toast versus that of my tooth which doesn't seem cost effective...  At least I got my calcium when I swallowed my own tooth chip -- I literally got \"my calcium\"!  If you have any old stale bread that you are considering throwing out or that has sat in the sun for a few days after accidentally being left on your back patio table following a meal outside by all means send it to Chakra 4 so they can then TOAST it then drizzle a little EVOO on it and serve it to their customers -- RECYCLE PEOPLE!  But don't expect any sympathy or cooperation if you leave their restaurant with your smile looking like Wil-E-Coyote's after he accidentally missed the Roadrunner and instead bit down on an Acme metal plate.
pos	Very good place for breakfast & lunch tucked away in the crowded shops at 44th & Camelback.  I kinda found this place on accident.  I meant to just run into AJs and grab a salad to go but was forced to park basically across the driveway from Taylor's and being closer I opted to go there instead.    Taylor's is open 6-4ish (I couldn't really tell they probably just changed the hours and scratched off the hour number on the door) and they serve breakfast all day- well all day they're actually open- which is always good with me.    I was in the mood for corned beef and  bingo there it was.  Nice mound of lean tasty beef with melty cheese (no saurkraut or thousand island please.).  And the bread- oh the bread- grilled to be crispy on the edges but still soft inside.  How in the hell do they do it?  I don't know but I'm in love.
neg	I  won't eat bagels in Phoenix so I am not here to review them.  I am only here to say that I had dinner there last night and the place is filthy.  The service awful at best.  The Reuben sandwich small flat greasy not enough dressing.  The partitions between the booths are so high that you can't see a server and they can't see you.  I had to wave my napkin high over the wall to get noticed.  And it's not like there were any other customers to serve.  A complete waste of time and money.
pos	Man oh Man!   Since leaving New York six and a half years ago I have been in search of good Chinese Food.  I had gotten to the point where I would have even settled for \"decent\".  A work colleague suggested that we dine here on the way to a corporate meeting.  While I realized that he was a native to the Phoenix Metro Area and had probably never even had the real thing I trusted his palate and restaurant sense.  I was so pleased when we walked in and saw that the diners were predominately Asian.  I knew that  a great  Asian market was next door as well and these things were the first things that signaled to me that I was probably going to get good food.  I was thrilled to see familiar Dim Sum carts rolling through.  We were a party of 7 and shared around.  The food was fantastic!  Dim sum was fresh and succulent.  Our orders from the menu were equally delicious.  The veggies were fresh and brightly colored.  The tastes distinctive and delicious.  The Hot and Sour Soup was perfect filled with all kinds of Chinese mushrooms etc.  I was delighted and reminisced about the many fantastic dinners in Chinatown NY. This food was comparable.  I do not live close by but I will be a regular there.  Chandler is clear on the other side of the World from me but I figure if Marco Polo could do it so can I!  Phoenix Palace is the REAL Thing!!!  Friendly prompt service rounded out the experience.  Hooray for Phoenix Palace!
neg	You would think in North Scottsdale an honest person could leave their sunglasses on the table by accident come back the next day they would have been saved by the waiter or the bus-boy. NOT AT SALTY'S. THEY ARE THIEVES! Not to mention the food is aweful and the staff could care less about service.
pos	First time here new favorite. You can create your own antipasti plate and the pretzels and fondue are AMAZING. Also the ricotta gnocchi is the best I have ever had. Service was good Liz was our waitress and she was very friendly and helpful. Monkey bread is also stellar. I cannot wait to go back.
neg	This was the worst experience that I've ever had with a refi...run away as fast as you can!  We opted to not go with the VA 4.25 they offered us and wanted a conventional refi....they tacked on fees that were in access of 16000 dollars at a 4.5 rate...and that is with excellent credit.  AND they won't even give you true quotes unless you give them $400 via credit card to start the process.   We ended up using DLJ financial in California....they were up front professional and DID NOT require crazy fees.  Our interest rate is way lower than what quicken quoted us and they responded to every email and phone call quickly. I have no idea how they got rated #1 by JDPowers....RUN AWAY...and use a different company.
pos	This little spot in the art district of Scottsdale is as good a lunch restaurant as I've been to.  I had the mahi mahi tacos and was blown away by the attention to detail in the flavors bringing the dish together as well as the wonderfully tasteful presentation.    Of particular note was the attractiveness level of the waitresses about which I don't have sufficient words to do justice.  Both my father and I were hard pressed not to buy a condo in Scottsdale just to stay and have all our meals for the rest of our life there solely to appreciate the view.  They were dressed tastefully not in the slightest bit 'slutty' but holy god.
neg	Remind me never to drive thru here again. If I check-in again - shoot me. I'm not a huge fan of Sonic except I like their limeades and crushed ice. I've never been to this location before and I won't recommend it.  The service was fine. The gentleman who took our order was patient and nice. However whoever prepared the food didn't prepare it as we ordered it. I asked for no mayo and got mayo. That pretty much ruins the burger. How can you take mayo off? Yuck. My daughter's chicken whatevers (bits? pieces? nuggets?) caused her to ask \"Is this chicken?\" She's 10 and not that picky. So that must have been pretty bad.  I thought it interesting that the drive thru guy encouraged me to fill out the survey to be entered for a drawing for a free something or other. Why? Because he didn't give my daughter any honey mustard sauce after he attentively asked how many packets she wanted. I usually don't fill out those surveys. I may start now...  Nice drive-thru guy. But absent-minded (I suppose we all have those days.) Good slushes and limeade. (This would be the only reason I'd come back.) Bad food.
pos	I have been frequenting this spot since they opened and have always said they were better than Starbucks but Iam in a special kind of heaven after the change in menu and addition of pressed tea lattes!!! Yum yum yum!!! Far better than Starbucks powdered green tea latte and roughly a dollar cheaper than the high priced cup there as well. The early morning staff is great and free WiFi is an added bonus. I can honestly say for the New Year I'm quitting you Starbucks......and mean it.
neg	Gross. The buffet was watery bland and luke-warm. The only vegetables included potatoes and an occasional pea. Also two of the dishes tasted like Velveeta.  Definitely not worth $11.
pos	I have totally fallen in love at Tuck Shop.  Everything here is fantastic.  My friend and I come here about twice a month and enjoy some snacks and wine.  The beer battered Cheese Curds may just change your life for the better... we are seriously tempted to each get our own order.   (I am not very good at sharing and i always get what I want!   ...No i'm not an only child... well maybe I was until i was 11 how did you know.  WAH!)     Oh and Laura is fantastic.  She always takes great care of us as we enjoy a glass of wine on the couch in the reading room.    Thursday's special is meat loaf... don't deny yourself just indulge.  :)
neg	Was hanging around Desert Ridge & decided to come here for lunch on a weekday.  I think this place used to be Cadillac Ranch but it seems all Notorious did was put some red picnic plaid table clothes (which was all torn up where I was sitting) & a bottle of bbq sauce and open for biz.   What a waste of a nice restaurant space!!!    So we got the family platter that consisted of: - 1/2 rack of ribs (they said it was lion back ribs (aka babyback) but all we got was spareribs...WTF!) - Pulled pork & brisket (bland & dry) - Hot links (spicy & smokey .....3*) - Sides: cole slaw (hard & under season) corn on the cob (soggy) & sweet potato fries (nothing special)  I feel really bad for the one waitress running all over the place.   I didn't mind that she didn't have time to refill my drinks b/c she was hostess waitress & cashier for the entire place.  Even the cooks came out to help a little.  So sad!
pos	I am one step closer to completing my goal.  I want to visit every Grimaldis in the US before I die.  After tonights visit to this one I have most of AZ taken care of.  We decided to come here because we had never been to this one.  We arrived and were seated right away.  Surprisingly this one wasn't crowded at all and that was fine by us.    We got a small caesar salad a small pepperoni and garlic and a personal white pizza with roasted red peppers.  A few minutes later we got our salad.  It was really good.  Just enough dressing lots of cheese and croutons.  It was a good starter.  A few minutes after that our pizza came out.  If you have read my other reviews you will know that I think Grimaldis is the best.....this pizza was no different.  I really liked the white with roasted red peppers.  Everything was delicious and even though there was some doubt we could finish off 2 pizzas I turned on my inner fat boy and finished off all the pizza.  It was tough but someone had to do it....little kids are starving in Africa somewhere....lll be damned if I'm going to waste some slices of this amazing pizza.  Down the hatch it went....my stomach doesn't like me right now because its so full but he will forgive me once he doesn't get any of this delicatessen back in San Diego LOL.
neg	Around 8 PM my roommates and I are hungry not wanting to cook so we decide on pizza. This Pizza Hut is a stone's throw from our house and we have a coupon sounds simple enough.  WRONG.  After ordering online I pull up to Pizza Hut around 8:30 and walk up to the door.It's locked. Confused I try the other door. Locked. There's a boy inside sweeping. He looks at me I gesture to the door and he then continues to sweep. Huh? I walk back to my car and look up the phone number on my GPS there is no answer so I drive home. I get to the house and tell my roommates what happened so we pull up the online order and see if we were able to order due to a glitch since they were obviously closed. 9 PM closing time. It's now about 8:45 or so and my phone rings as we are still looking at the computer.  \"Hey this is... from Pizza Hut.. are you going to pick up your pizza?\" Um... I tried.. \"Okay.. so how long will it take you to get here?\" Um... 5 minutes I guess...  I drive back and walk up to the door. The door is still locked that kid in the corner is still sweeping. I knock loudly on the door and three people appear from the back kitchen area.   \"Sorry about the mix up we upgraded your order for you.\" Open the box- instead of the Supreme Pizza Mia we ordered is a very old looking pepperoni stuffed-crust pizza. Huh? \"So the total is $16.25.\" What? Is this happening?  .. Um I'm not paying for this... Everyone looks at everyone awkwardly but the kid in the corner keeps sweeping. \"Oh.. Okay..hold on.\" The man in a tie who I assume is the manager goes into the back and grabs one of their new pasta dishes and puts it on top of the unwanted pizza. \"Tell you what- Dinner is on me today miss have a great night.\" Um.. okay.. Thanks... Never got an explanation for the bizarre first trip and more importantly never even got the pizza we ordered.  Drove back home.
pos	As good as I always remember it to be. Their fries are way better than In-n-Out (I am a fries connoisseur)  Their burgers may be getting smaller? Still delicious as ever.  I pass on the drink though an extra $2+ makes the meal quite expensive..  Price: $9+ for the cheeseburger (double) and Regular fries (in-n-out: $6+ for double-double and fries - half the size)  I would eat here every day if I had the option.
neg	After waiting for over an hour (also with 2 little kids )I finally get my $16.00 spicy chicken pasta and the noodles are hard... this isn't what I would expect after waiting so long. At this point I have no desire of waiting for them to bring me a new plate.  They didn't even offer to take it off the bill! There are tons of places to choose in this area I'm  not sure I will ever go back.
pos	Love this place it's on our dinner rotation. The owners and wait staff always greet us since we are regulars. Great place and cheap too. Try the #100 its the best ever.
neg	I don't know where all those people who have given them 4-5 stars rating We went in there for the 1st time from San Diego where they know how to make Mexican Food. We waited 43 mins. before being waited on and served. The food was less then mediocre at best and the service is below average. 1st and last time there.
pos	Owned and operated by Eugenia Theodosopoulos (an Ohio native fyi) and considered by many to be the best patisserie/bakery in the state I approached Essence with a note of skepticism largely assuming much of the hype was derived from Tempe's plethoric college crowd but arriving at the doors of the small shop on a particularly lovely 80 degree morning I gathered quite quickly that my original conceptions were misplaced; not only does Essence not look like a college haunt neither do its prices or products - a vast selection of at least twenty items aside from the posted menu sitting beneath and atop a glass case forcing me to make more than one tough decision that was not helped by my server's accurate assessment that everything was really good.  Now bearing in mind that the original impetus to visit Tempe on this particular morning was to visit Caffe Boa and that Essence was more of 'pre-meal' activity what follows may seem slightly gluttonous but to be fair once I took my first bite of Theodosopoulos's École Lenôtre trained almond croissant I knew I was in good hands and everything else just sort of followed.  Without a doubt my favorite breakfast pastry and perhaps my favorite French pastry overall Essence's $3 twice baked option arrives slightly smaller than the average but with a shell that crackles to the tooth and an interior that is at once yawning pockets of air and nearly overloaded with butter and light frangipane there is no doubt that this is a case of \"big things in small packages\" and particularly in its still-warm morning state the flavors and textures rivaled those at Dominique Ansel and Payard Las Vegas for best I've had stateside.  Moving next from the baked goods to one prepared from the menu my second taste of the morning aside from the slightly earthy and lightly leather accented coffee was Essence's \"Signature\" French Toast a $7.25 selection featuring three griddled slices of eggy brioche and a sidecar of what I can best describe as banana infused caramel.  Rich but thinly sliced and therefore nicely saturated each piece of the French Toast was exactly as it should be - the exterior crisp and the interior custard-while the sauce provided a pleasant balance of fruity notes and intrinsic sweetness that complimented rather than overwhelming the bread.  At this point submitting to the fact that I was going to eat even the items I'd bought 'for later' my next two tastes were a pair of $2.95 macarons that much like the croissant rivaled those both here and abroad in terms of taste and texture while opting for a much more rustic approach terms of size and presentation.  Beginning first with Pumpkin Spice and then proceeding to Vanilla with Dark Rum each palm-sized cookie was exactly what one would expect from a well trained pastry chef as the exterior shell provided a slight crackle on bite subsequently giving way to a soft meringue followed by dense cream that slowly dissipated on the tongue - the cinnamon and nutmeg notes of the former particularly notable while the rum in the second was appropriately understated thus serving to highlight the vanilla of the shell.  If there were any 'misstep' on the morning it *might* have been the \"Summer Berry Croissant Bread Pudding\" though when I say misstep I must temper the comment with the fact that my quibble is only that I prefer the French/English take on the dish while this one was more based on the French Custard style a rich vanilla bean pudding without a lot of crunch or textural variance but instead laden with blackberries raspberries and strawberries plus a sidecar of lightly sugared strawberries.  Focusing more of the natural sweetness of the fruits and aromatics of the vanilla than the typical overly sweet versions served stateside it was more panna cotta than bread pudding to me but chalking that up to personal tastes it was still delicious.  Moving last to the one dish that gave me trepidation the \"French Napoleon\" gave caused pause not only because the name clearly skewed towards a subset unfamiliar with a proper Mille-Feuille but also because so many pre-made versions of this layered pastry have failed to wow in the past...thankfully this was not the case at Essence.  Featuring light and crunchy layers of choux easily withstanding the tines of a fork without turning into a smooshy mess (see \"Mille Feuille New York\") intertwined with rich pastry cream speckled with dots of vanilla bean and ripe raspberries what truly made this version stand out was the manner in which Theodosopoulos caramelized each layer of choux a technique reminiscent of Pierre Herme and as good as the French icon's version was I'd be hard pressed to say Essence's was any less impressive.  It would be awesome to see what they could do a la minut like Savoy L'Arpege or Genin and given the names I've dropped in the paragraphs above plus Essence's proximity I've no doubt I'll be returning to see what else the small shop is capable of soon.
neg	If there was such a thing as zero stars- this place would be it!   A friend a I went for Restaurant week and the food was nothing to ever go back to. We had the crab \"cakes\" which I am surprised they can even get away with calling it that- more like fried crab and mayonnaise balls.   Then we had both had a Chili and Coffee rubbed Scallops. They cut the scallops in half to make it look like more dunked them in a oil bath and then poured coffee grinds and chili paste all over... mmm yummy!!!   The best part of the meal comes with the check: they neglected to tell us that after a month of being in business they still have not connect their American Express machine. When we went to pay the server said \"ohh we can't take that yet.\" To which my friend and I argued that we should have been notified ahead of time what if we have nothing else to pay with?? The conversation gets so ridiculous that the manager comes over and tells us it's not his fault and there is nothing he can do so I will have to pay for the entire meal with cash or another credit card. \"I told my servers to tell each table\" he said. I'm pretty sure that's not a good enough explanation.   I am sparing you tons of heated details... the bottom line is I give this place 5 months tops and it will be donzo!
pos	I'm on a community social action committee and have spent the last year planning a community-wide service day. We were each responsible to lead a team of volunteers in a different community service project and per my passion I chose the Humane Society. We arrived on Sunday afternoon with a group of 12 people at the Campus for Compassion on Dobbins Rd. Kathy - the head of volunteer services - met with us and gave us a thorough introduction. She included the history of the AZ humane society and the process and procedures by which they take-in and shelter animals. She really focused on promoting spaying and neutering pets and cited some very impressive statistics. Did you know that over 7 years un-neutered  cats can breed to reach 420000 in numbers??!!!! and dogs 67000??!!! thats CRAZY and so compelling.   Kathy proceeded by giving us a very educational tour of the facilities... we saw dogs horses cats and bunnies. It was very eye-opening. First off it shattered any stigma you have about a shelter. The animal accommodations are so impressive!! The dogs have BIG size kennels with indoor and outdoor spaces that are really spacious. I was nervous to go in and see the dogs in kennels but I really wasn't as heartbroken as I thought I'd be bc they really had nice size spaces.   There are sprawling lawns in the back where animals can run and play which even include a public dog park! There are also private puppy rooms.  The cats have big crates as well and even private bedrooms where they can hang out in groups and the facilities were squeaky clean w/o any odors.   The volunteers were so nice kind and devoted to the animals. We got to feed horses play with cats and bunnies and put together leashes for dogs. The most encouraging thing though was that the place was busy on a sunday! buzzing with people wanting to adopt pets and several cats were actually adopted during the 2 hours we were there.  It was a wonderful and meaningful experience and I encourage anyone who is looking for a pet to adopt from the Humane Society and to look into volunteering with them
neg	Out of business not surprising they have been going down hill for years.
pos	Every time I go in this place it's always a great experience.  My wife and I have been going to Lucille's pretty much every other Sunday for the last couple months.  Her favorite is the pulled pork mine is the Kansas City ribs but we always have to start our meal off with the fried pickles.  If you're on a tight budget even buying one meal and sharing it is a definite option.  Sometimes I get full on the biscuits and spread the provide in the beginning.  The bar area is a great place to have a meal and watch a game.  I would highly recommend this establishment to any of my friends.  But make sure you get the fried pickles... you will not be disappointed.  Oh yeah.....please please please order the Mac 'N Cheese as your side.  You will thank me later.  Q
neg	The ideal customer for this store is someone who is heavily armed and who has the patience of Ghandi. You would need both to safely navigate the waters of this disastrous store.  This is the nearest grocer for downtown residents and it is sad that this store misses the mark by such a huge margin.  On any day the parking lot is covered in grease coffee and trash. IF by some miracle you are able to get inside without being hit up for money by tweakers then the heavens are smiling on you.  Once inside the store your adventure is just starting. The characters inside the store are the inspiration for the bar scene in Star Wars. Very random and sketchy. As far as the contents of the store to be fair they have all the stuff you need and at a reasonable price point.  The huge problem here is everything else. During peak hours they have very few lanes open that is a consistent failure with this store. Customer service is also dead here and they just don't know how to take care of customers. I feel as though the broken window theory is at play here. It seems like because they don't take care of the parking lot and other details the whole place goes to hell. The store also has a serious shoplifting problem. I'm not sure if they just don't staff the loss prevention unit or if they are inept but I have seen at least four episodes where a cashier is confronting a thief. It makes for an unsafe situation for everyone. They do have private security there and the guys seem really nice but clearly in over their heads. At this point the store is so far gone they really need off-duty police officers to make it safe.  It really seems like this store just doesn't give a shit. At each opportunity to impress the complete opposite happens. This place is a huge safety problem and I would hate to have my sisters or Mom go to this place it's really that shady. See for yourself but be on your toes.
pos	I highly reccomend this place. They helped my girlfriend and I figure out our taxes and deductions so that we could get the max refund. We both had been doing our taxes online and missing out on hundreds in deductions. Ill never use another online service to do my taxes again as long as these guys are here.
neg	This place makes me hate Mexican food. Everything is fried... bland and gross.  Don't expect to leave without adding 2000+ calories to your daily diet.  I know that other people have raved about their $2 beer happy hours. This place is right off Mill Ave!! There are better happy hours and better beers all around Mill!  This place is the McDonald's in the ghetto version of a Mexican restaurant.
pos	My absolute favorite coffee shop - I'm a regular! Friendly atmosphere & staff buttery fluffy muffins ooey gooey danishes tasty coffee and support for local businesses and entrepreneurs.  The only negative for me is the mysterious disappearance of the corn tortilla bagel (much yummier than it sounds)!
neg	Kinda gross that the cook had his hair loose. Also the nachos weren't all that flavorful. Def not worth $8.
pos	There's no business like show business. As any of my friends will tell you I am a theater junkie. I could sit in a theater all day all week all year long and do nothing but gaze at live performances of theatrical talent. lol! Well in actuality hmmmmmmm I really could. I am not even joking on that. I probably would if someone brought me water every now and again. LOL!  Ok seriously now Childsplay is my favorite organization in Az for a host of reasons.     My dear friends of Childsplay know who they are. This is children's theater at it's best! The Q and A sessions after each show is a plus. The kids love it. I have to admit I do too since I get to go say hi to my friends after each stage-show. I also learn more techniques that I can steal when I teach drama to my inner city students. Teehee!  ( Yes I am a teacher and yes I would die to have some of their costumes and sets)     I have seen so many wonderful plays literature remakes and original scripts performed At TCPA and by Childsplay. Fernidad BFG and New Kid were only some of the most amazing masterpieces I have had the distinct pleasure of viewing from these talented actors. Debbie Scott Katie Jodi; well all of them! LOVE YOU!    Childsplay also has an artist in Residence program for schools. We have had an artist at our school for several years. It is wonderful to note that the teaching techniques classroom teachers are learning are helping tomorrows future. Time after time I have seen struggling kids blossom under their tutelage.      Of importance to note TCPA is a beautiful facility. You can enjoy a nice venue along with the superstar talent. What more can you ask for?      The only negative I can possibly imagine is that in today's hard times the cost may be inhibiting to some families. But if you like them on Facebook they sometimes have discounted tickets and contests to win free tickets. A great way to start viewing them and get involved.     I do hope everyone continues to support the arts here in Az. As I have stated in my other \"ARTS\" reviews I do worry about cultural program survival in Az with recent state budget cuts. Soooooooo as a famous circus/rodeo person once said \"Go On With The Show\".
neg	If I could give this place zero stars I would. I am going to California next weekend and was told to try Roscoes Chicken and Waffles. That sounded like a good idea to me and I thought I should try a chicken and waffles place here in Phoenix and compare. Well I found Off Da Hook and thought it sounded pretty good so off I went.     Sadly I will never know if this place is good or not. When I walked in the place was pretty full with a few people sitting on the little couch in front of the area where you pay. I stood for a second then asked the people on the couch if they had ordered already. This is when then wheels came off. The guy sitting on the couch was rude when he told me they had already ordered. I thought I would wait a sec for the guy standing at the register to finish before I went up to place my to go order. When he left I walked up and waited for the person to come back and take my order. As I stood there I looked around the place and saw a very large employee looking at me. After a minute or so he walked over to me and said \"why dont you have a seat and someone will take your order.\" I said no problem and mentioned it was a to go order. He looked at me and very rudely said \"yah thats fine just sit down and we will be with you in a minute.\" I then sat down and the asshole stepped behind me about a foot and started talking to the people sitting on the couch. He sat there and very loudly started insulting me. Telling the people on the couch how stupid I was for standing in front of the register to place a to go order. He was no more than a foot away from me while he was doing this. This is nothing but disgusting behavior. No way in hell am I every going to let anyone to treat me in this manor. I stood up and walked out. This guy is a pig and nothing but. DO NOT GO TO THIS PLACE FOR ANYTHING OR ANY REASON. On the way to this dump I drove by Chik-a-rib just down the street so I went there instead. The people there were incredibly nice and bent over backwards to help me while I was there. I ordered the chicken and waffles with onion rings and mac n cheese. THERE FOOD WAS FANTASTIC!!! If you want chicken this is the place to go. Not where the rude assholes work.
pos	Great great food.  Best meal I had all week in Scottsdale.
neg	Update 3/22/12 - Judy B. has deleted the review.  Update 3/19/12 - Frenchie B. is user Judy B. now.    Updated 3/16/12:  First I was glad to see the owner private message regarding our experience there that was nice.  But then I noticed the same user end \"Frenchie B.\" wrote a review for Au Petit Four too.    Private Message:  \"May be you were shocked by the price you paid let me tell you we did not rise our price from the esplanade.  You 2 cakes and 2 creme brulee and they are the most expensive of the 10 items ingredients we use are very expensive and high quality.  You should ask the detail bill to Pierre there is no reason you did not have it.  Do not feel ripped off I feel sorry because you came over to Scottsdale but I also Hope to see you again soon.  Thank you and have a nice week end.\"  Part of their review on 3/9/12 states: \"Also  if 50 dollars is to expensive for you after having 2 sodas especially the delicious lemonades who are from france so they are more expensive then a can of coke 2 meals and 2 desserts then mcdonalds is better for you..price wise of course.\"   After review their review I was shock to see how they think about their customers.  How 2 faced can you get.  Nice in the private message and then blast a customer on a public review.  If I would have had 2 drinks 2 meals and 2 desserts for $50 that is a great deal.  We had 5 non-alcoholic drinks 4 desserts and a cookie for $48.50.  You know we should have taken the kids to McDonalds for dessert.

pos	I would suggest that anyone who lives here and has not been come and if you're in town and looking for a great local non-chain restaurant that has quality food prepared the way it should then try Cibo!    I took my man here for \"mystery date night\" as a surprise since he had never been.  No wait at 8:45 on a Friday night (yes! take that Pizzeria B) and the atmosphere of this house is super intimate and cool.  I love the atmosphere of the patio also lit with those great off-white lights and fire pits.  We shared the burrata which was gynormus easily enough for 4 people or a hungry us.  The wine was tasty and reasonable.  I was drinking a pinot grigio and my guy had the house chianti which I never usually order anywhere since it almost always reminds of grandmas table wine - until I tried Cibo's house version.  It was very good definitely not from grandmas!   Now for the pizza - it is just perfection.  It has that amazing combination of char on the crust crispy on the outside chewy on the inside with the right balance of sauce and toppings.  It almost melts in your mouth it's not heavy at all.  It's nice to go out for a pizza dinner with and app and dessert and not feel like you have to roll yourself out of the joint!  So we finished our romantic mystery date night with a crepe filled with nutella ricotta AND a scoop of ice cream on top.  I don't typically die over dessert it's my boyfriends thing.  I'm an app girl - but this it wasn't too sweet it was so gooey and delicious and the ice cream added just the right amount of sweetness.  I would never eat here without dessert again!    I have been for lunch and they can get you in and out in a little less than an hour but they don't fire up the pizza oven till supper which is why I prefer that here.  You will feel at home at this spot in a group or on a date - hell maybe even a mystery one :)
neg	We went to the Shimogamo for the first time on Friday night.  A dour man who appeared to be the manager approached us and said \"We have no more space.\"  Not a greeting not offer of a wait time not anything but \"no more space\".  We left without having an food because we were definitely not welcome; more of an inconvenience the manager.
pos	I am always comfortable in Michelina's the service is excellent and they are not rushing you to \"turn the table\".  Michelina's cooking is fantastic!  Her daily specials are so inviting that I rarely order from the menu.  The drinks are excellent bread just right and the after dinner complimentary cordial is a nice finish.  One of the best kept secrets in Phoenix!
neg	I purchase a groupon for $119 for 4 hours of window cleaning. I called to schedule on 10/13. The girl that answered asked when I wanted the job done. I said as long as it was before thanksgiving I was good. That was 40 days from now. She said she didn't think she could get me in by then and asked when my groupon expired. Expiration is 12/19. She said she could get me in 2 days before the expiration if I wanted to use my groupon. She said as an alternative she could get me in at regular price less 10\% if I didn't want the promo rate on my groupon. She said she would even apply the $119 I paid for the groupon to the regular price she wanted to charge. Wow what a scam. I said maybe I should call groupon and tell them about this. She said groupon is real good about giving refunds and maybe I should do that. I have never seen a company put out and offer and so blatantly not honor it. This company has zero integrity and does not deserve your business. I am a HUGE supporter of small business as a small business owner myself and it was not an easy decision to write this negative review but what right is right and this whole interaction with this company was wrong. Please find someone else to clean your windows or power wash your home.
pos	I am a hot dog lover.   For the past five years I've found no greater joy in Phoenix than hitting up Nogales Dogs for the best meal on the planet. Each evening when the Keyboard City on 20th St. and Indian School closes the parking lot is converted into a quaint little dining atmosphere. I most enjoy going around six the sun is setting and the buzz of traffic makes Phoenix seem more alive. This is my own preference and I know many people who hate going at this time because of the loud traffic. The bacon wrapped dogs are made to perfection with your choice of mayo beans tomatoes onions jalapenos cheese mushrooms and lettuce. And to top it all off you can wash it down with a Mexican Coca Cola mmm so sugar filled. Don't forget to bring cash and your appetite.
neg	I've had the worst experience at this Wendy's.  I could do a long rant but I'll make this short.  1) My 5 year old was served a RAW cheeseburger.  They walked this cow right through the damn kitchen. 2) Only one employee seemed to speak enough English for me to attempt to complain. 3) The ONLY thing I was given in compensation was a free kiddie frosty.  The manager (wherever they were hiding) didn't even come out to apologize.  The employees were too busy doing a chant for Obama than to worry about actually doing there jobs.  While I don't care who they wanted for president it's a bit disturbing that this was okay with management.  If my son gets sick I promise you that compensation will not be just a frosty.  I've worked near here for over 10 years and it used to be good but it has really gone downhill over the years.
pos	Best Greek food I had in Arizona and excellent entertainment.  The dolma's were the best I've had their version of Babaganoush was very good and they had many lamb-based dishes.  The entertainment was great. Live music belly dancing greek-style fun broken plates and dancing.  Since I had the sampler plate I can tell you that if you're vegan vegetarian or any other wacko thing like that you might not enjoy the food here (Greek Lasagna?....really?) Also the chicken was no good but I don't really like chicken anyway.
neg	Tried to get my oil change and tires rotated on my truck here today but I decided against it because apparently one of their jacks is broken. That means that they only have one jack which is being used all the time which means that its probably about to break as well.  It's definitely not going to be my truck that falls to the ground when this jack breaks.  I also went to another Jiffy Lube near by on Apache and McClintock same story.
pos	Clean organized and well-stocked (for the most part) Fujiya's carries my favorite car freshener chips bread and iced coffee (in a can) among many other good things. Reasonably priced and extremely courteous customer service I am always happy to shop there. The bentos I wish are kept in warmers like Suruki in San Mateo CA but Fujiya has an area adjacent to the register which includes a microwave to heat your purchased bento so you can sit and eat and relax after shopping. What I love so much about their service is that I can place my order ahead of time and they'll have it available and ready. I think this is the only Japanese store that has just about everything I need to stock my pantry. It's no wonder I've been coming here year after year.
neg	Yet another disappointing Asian establishment in AZ. I know Lees is a chain and maybe I just happened to be the unlucky customer but geeeeez!  Skimped on my meat and veggies. Was only enough to fill half the sandwich. I ordered the grilled pork sandwich and also the BBQ pork. Both were dry... Meat was tough... No flavor... Sandwich was dry and the pickled carrots and radish tasted funny. Sad night :( went home and made salad rolls instead.
pos	What a great find! Located off of Yelp after a business meeting in the area & we were hungry before we hit the road. Very comfortable space lighting is good so you can see each other & your food which is not always the case. The decor is not overwhelming but extremely comfortable some TV's Thai decor & more pop music on the overhead. The staff was extremely attentive from the moment we walked in through out the meal. My Jasmin iced tea never got to the bottom. The menu has great variety. The pad Thai was excellent as were the vegetarian rolls. The Tom Ka soup was excellent. Every member of our group got something different and they were all extremely happy. We will be back. Pricing was very reasonable. There is patio seating available. Check it out.
neg	I loved Chuy's their baja tacos will always be a fond memory for me.  This location is closed and probably will be forever.  They weren't playing by the rules.  Go across the street for some good eats.
pos	Today was the fist time I have been to Chino Bandito. My friend has been there several times and loves this place. After having a few beers we were pretty hungry and decited to go here. This place is mixed in a sort of industrial corner behind a Walgreens and a transmission shop. Walking in you will notice how big this place is inside. Customer service was excellent. The counter person was great in explaining the different options on the menu which is a mix of Mexican food and Chinese food. Great concept for something different. For ten dollars I had the Carnitas burrito and a Jerk chicken burrito with Jerk fried rice and black beans and a large iced tea (all you can drink). It also comes with a Snikerdoodle cookie. Wait time was minimal and the food was brought very quickly to our table. I really enjoyed the items that I had order and I found the carnitas had the right flavor and tenderness in a burrito (you can also get it in a bowl). The Jerk chicken burrito had some zing to it. Enough to make me sweat a little. One thing that I noticed was that the employee's were really good about keeping the place clean. Sweeping cleaning the tables wiping up around the drink dispensers. I also noticed that they wrap all of the highchair trays in plastic to keep the clean and dust free. One last thing they have free wifi!
neg	I've gotten sick from this food a few times. The worst food option in park central
pos	Too long.......it took me way too long to make it to Sens. Sens is what we need more of in Phoenix!  Seated promptly on a Friday night by Johnny Chu himself Johnny Chu really has put together a winner here Johnny Chu.....alright I admit it...I like saying his name!  The Asian tapas idea is new to me having dined at some great Tapas places from Chicago to Vegas  but alas never an Asian tapas joint. I must say no Spanish tapas place ever made me feel like Sens did (except the time I drank a pitcher of Sangria)!  The Tofu dishes are amazing. How do you learn to love Okra? Get it at Sens. The Hong Kong rice noodles were not what I was expecting so I was a little taken back by them looking like a plateful of water chestnuts. One taste was all that was needed to cure my trepidations about the flavor - fantastic!  I will be back to Sens Tapas & Sake Bar soon - do you think you could invent an \"Asian Sangria\"? C'mon Johnny I know you can do it!
neg	Worse food and service I've ever experienced. Extremely rude people work here! They were busy and a nasty waitress added drinks we never even ordered then was rude when we questioned her. She removed the drinks then was a complete bitch! I suggest you pay as you order for drinks or really check your bill before you pay!
pos	Great home made taste on the meatballs.  Also they have diet coke.  Shop was nice and clean.  Friendly and fast service
neg	I've been to better Outbacks in the ghetto's of Detroit.  Went once ordered prime rib...ordered it med rare it came out gray.  Server NEVER came back.  Wife finished meal went to hostess stand and asked for manager.  Manager apologized didn't take plate away.  Server came back and I asked her to get this plate out of my site.  She told me not to be angry she had other tables.    My food was comped got a $25 gift card left hungry.  Gave card to a friend.  I'll never go to a chain steak place again.    I was also told by a former Outback manager that Downtown Scottsdale Outback is one of the lowest rated Outback's in the country.  Go figure.
pos	What can I say except that Jodi is incredible. I had purchased an online deal because I've always wanted to do something like this and thought it to be a great gift for my other half. I sent her a message and she quickly responded. Almost everything I needed to know for the shoot was emailed to me. You have the opportunity to do your own hair and makeup or have someone she works with do it at a reasonable rate. I highly recommend that you get it done by her ladies. That day I saw Erica. She was really fun and got me into the mood (the glass of wine helped too :-) ) and she did an incredible job with the makeup and hair. For those who feel a little nervous I do recommend bringing some wine along with you. It really loosens you up a bit and allows you to be more comfortable. It was perfect since my first photos were the nude shots. Note: wear loose fitting clothing nothing elastic and be sure that you do not have a sunburn on your body. Let your hair air dry and it is OK to put on your own serums and moisturizers prior to the shoot. Make sure nothing with sunscreen gets on your face and while it's not necessary I made sure to use a primer. I thought it really helped out with how my makeup set. Be prepared to pose in positions that may be a bit awkward and also note that you will likely be sore the next day from the different twisting that you have to do. Jodi really knows how to make you feel comfortable and at ease. I don't make a habit of being in the buff in front of complete strangers and for me to drop my robe without feeling shy was a big deal for me. It helped that I had my own music mix on my iPod throughout the entire shoot as well. The overall whole experience was incredible. I felt sexy and confident. I went back with my honey to look at the photos. He really really liked them and had a hard time choosing which he wanted to go into the album. I can't wait to see everything finished. I can't wait to do it again :) Thank you Jodi for making it such a memorable experience. I highly recommend her and her ladies!!!
neg	Popped in here on a whim one day and wandered around for a bit.  Didn't actually want to really touch much of anything I felt like I was in that show \"Hoarders\" but the hoarder had OCD....so it was slightly organized filthy crap.  The furniture in the back looked so sad I can't imagine any other Goodwill in the valley accepting it.  Most of it looked like it had been scavenged from next to dumpsters.  I did end up buying a few of the bags of cloth they have but only because they are for sewing projects and I knew I could dump them in the washer and sterilize the crap out of them when I got home.    I love going to thrift stores but this was slumming at a level I could not have imagined.
pos	The best burgers in Phoenix. The owners are great and am on a first name basis. Forget about fast food and support this local business.   Go double. Add bacon. Park at Circle K if in a hurry. Plan on holding it until you get home. Stick to the burger and fries genius.
neg	One of the worst hotels I stayed in anywhere.  During my spring training visit earlier this year almost every day I had trouble with the door key cards.  Very poor decor also.
pos	So for my date tonight to the Compass Room I needed to get my nails done.  I removed my acrylics myself last week.   I read the reviews here and decided to try DV. You know sometimes when you walk into a nail shop for the first time it's almost like the Soup Nazi.  Not this place! There were two girls ahead of me so I waited a bit but only about ten minutes.   It's bigger than the place I had been going to!  Really clean and I heard ENGLISH being spoken by the nail techs!  That was nice.  Yeah there were still speaking Vietnamese (or so I think) to each other yes probably about us gringas but it was refreshing to hear actualy conversations. I had Le.  She was so sweet!  I told her all about my date too. She was quick and made some suggestions about what to get.  Usually I like clear tips that they have to paint.  I was kinda short on time so I went with her suggestion of white tips.  Plus it was about $5 cheaper. She was quick but *really* methodical.   I think this may be the nicest set of acrylics I've gotten out here in the PHX! She even called me by name throughout the conversation. $25 for a new full set.  Not bad at all
neg	We ordered a couple pizzas tonight via their on-line system and were given an estimated delivery time of about 25 minutes.  We thought this sounded quite short but were willing to give them a little leeway.  After they missed the estimated delivery time by 45 minutes I called to see what the status of our pizza was.  Alexa or Alexis (not sure which) answered the phone and as soon as she pulled up our order she started apologizing profusely she put me on hold and after a few minutes another person answered the phone with much more of a gruff voice didn't say anything except \"this is ???? (didn't catch name).  I figured the phone had been picked up by someone else so I told her I was talking to the other person.  She told me she was the manager and that the driver said he tried to deliver the pizza and the woman that answered the door told him they already got their pizza?!?!  Since it's my wife and I that were home both expecting the pizza and both irritated that it hadn't arrived there is no way that happened at this house.  I couldn't tell if the driver messed up terribly or if this was their cover story for messing up our order and not getting it out.  Granted...they did offer to recook the pizzas and deliver them for free but at this point they are done in my book.  The last thing I want is a pizza cooked and delivered by disgruntled people.  This is the last time we will ever attempt to get a pizza from them and highly recommend you use caution when ordering.
pos	Feeling yucky one day and wanting nothing but some reminders of my bay area asian food... My search began with my iPhone for Pho.. AND I wanted good Pho.. (Im skeptical of some dishes in the desert just sayin'!).. I drove a good 20min from my loft to find this place.. worth it. Usual toppings you will find with real Vietnamese Pho.. but awesome! I asked for a variety of tofu and seafood.. I couldnt finish it all.. but never can with Pho.. its a big bowl and filling!  Extras on tables to get your Pho on..  Ordered the Vietnamese Shrimp Rolls too.. left feeling not so stuffy! AND full.. OH yeah and I still had money for a bit of shoe shopping the next day... :-)
neg	We started going to the \"BIRD\" as we call it starting the second week that it first opened. As time went on they just kept getting better and better. We would go sometimes 2-4 time a week. Then they changed owners but wanting to give the new owners a chance we went a few more times. In our opinion it went down the flusher. They starting changing certain items trying to go on the cheap. Too bad. Why people buy a successful business then change things I don't know. The killer for us was on our 4th retry the bacon was no longer nice full pieces they were shriveled up tiny pieces that would fit inside a teaspoon spoon. We said that's enough. Too bad. Several other friends that we had recommended to go there in the beginning has also quit going due to their changes. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME !!! DON VICKIE & ANDREW
pos	My wife's work had their Christmas party here last night. Although the customer service was slow and average at best the food was outstanding. I had a burger and my wife the steak salad. I was the DD but my wife said the margaritas were excellent. Dessert was tiramisu and sweet potato cheesecake. Great little place with a nice vibrant ambiance.
neg	I love pizza.  I really don't have a better way to start a review other than me sharing my love for pizza.  Meat cheese and carbs all put together that also acts as its own servicing dish just seems genius to me.  I love Vincent's Pizza but their delivery service is awful.  I recommend either eating there or ordering pick up.  Meal:  I usually order the smallest of the sizes with Italian sausage and fresh mozzarella and cannolis.     Taste:  Vincent's has the best pizza and awesome cannolis.  Their pizza is New York style and has the right amount of \"floppiness\" to it.  Their ingredients seems to be top notch and fresh.  This is the real deal pizza.  10 out of 10.  Value:  This is expensive pizza but I am probably the wrong the person to ask about this because once I find a pizza I love I will pay almost anything for it.  I wish they did serve a smaller size pizza for individuals (the fiance doesn't care for New York style pizza) so that means you end up having a bunch of left over pizza. 2 out of 5.  Service/Cleanliness:  Here is why they got one star.  Their customer service is awful awful awful! If you ask for a pizza to be delivered it takes well over two hours . . . even though they will wuote you that it will take a little over an hour.  One two separate occasions the price given over the phone ends up being lower what you have to pay when it arrives to the door.  And finally ever single time you call them asking 'where the heck is my pizza' the managers/owner always throw their own people under the bus instead of stepping up to the plate and being accountable.  Service at the physical restaurant isn't that much better either.  0 out of 10.  Atmosphere:  Very generic decorating.  Can't remember if there was music.  Could use a major overhaul.  1 out of 5.  Overall:  If the service wasn't so god awful they would be my go to pizza place in the valley.  The taste is absolutely amazing . . . . it is in my top 3 pizza places.  But the service is so completely awful the taste isn't work it.  13 points out of 30 5 out of 5 stars.
pos	Sauce is my kind of place.  Great inexpensive food casual yet trendy atmosphere perfect location.    Located right by Urban Outfitters and Olive and Ivy at the Scottsdale Waterfront I like Sauce as a pre or post shopping bonanza meal.  I always have the same thing: the mozzarella and tomato salad (which you should know is mostly greens with chucks of each drizzled in balsamic) and the artichoke and portabella pizza.  This is a huge meal so I always have leftovers which make for the perfect 2am after-bar treat.    If youre feeling particularly saucey you can have yourself a glass of wine as well.
neg	We ate here before going to see the Sharks/Coyotes game in March. It was busy- most likely because of the biker rally and the hockey game- but we were seated in a reasonable amount of time. I ordered a chicken ceasar salad which was very boring and run of the mill. I actually didn't eat the chicken at all just because there wasn't any flavoring on it and it was cold chicken. Perhaps if it was warm it would have been palatable.  About halfway through the meal I started to feel incredibly sick and started to get a headache. I realized once we were done that a lightbulb high on the ceiling right above our table was flickering and it made me sick. I did not bring my migraine medication with me to dinner and was forced to sit through a hockey game with a terrible upset stomach and migraine. Needless to say it pretty much ruined the game.  I would hope that the management would take better care of the building.
pos	Loved it! Best French toast ever!
neg	I came in contact with this company via Home Depot.   Communication was horrible. My quote came a week later than they said and after I emailed them did it come a day later.  When I had questions I received a brief answer. I felt after 3 attempts of clarifying the quote that I was pulling teeth to get information. It really shouldn't be that way!!  I guess I'm of the frame of mind that when someone wants to do business they try to be as professional and upfront as they can. That they try to \"wow\" the customer with information so that they can make a decent and informed decision. After all I would be the person \"paying them!\"   The way I figure it if a company can't perform very simple basic follow up follow through and professional communication at the start they're not going to be successful in managing a landscaping project until the end making sure that the customer is happy.   Look they obviously did a few things right back in 2008 from the other reviews but they are not doing so well right now. I passed on their services happily and knowing that I just saved myself a huge mega headache.
pos	I used Harvil's Auto Body after a fender bender. They were one of the auto body places that was included in State Farm's program. They were efficient friendly proactive highly-responsive and helpful. I especially appreciated that they kept me updated on the progress of my automobile and advocated for me/my vehicle when needed. This level of high-quality customer services is hard to come by. If you have a choice choose Harvil's. You won't be disappointed.
neg	The McManager sucks.  (he wouldn't run his store Safeway card for me!)  The debit/credit card swipers suck! (they don't fit in their holders and they must use a freakin' dialup modem they are so God Damn slow)  They once completely ran out of MILK!  Their change machine was down for well over a week!  I swear to God if  there were any alternative in the vicinity I'd GLADLY pay twice the price to shop there!   Revamped store is nice to look at shitty to shop at!    Now with free Wi-Fi!   EAT ME!
pos	Came for the beer stayed for the scenery.
neg	I HATE JACK IN THE CRACK...the only time I can eat here is if I've been drinking and everyone in the car is craving it. Not like I got a say I never drink and drive :) so when we all pull up my drunken ass orders something.   THIS PARTICULAR jack just is horrible!!!! The past 3 times!!! Drinks get mixed up...fries are missing...tomatos are there when they shouldn't...foods cold...forget my sauce for the eggrolls :( ya don't judge i tried the eggrolls and they were horrible and dry. And it's really hard to make eggrolls taste bad but jack in the box sure was able to do it.
pos	Great subs the Club Supreme mike's style was really good
neg	NEVER AGAIN! (at least not for me...this is a hotel for a different crowd) For me the best part about this hotel was that happy hour which lasts until 8 serves $5 glasses of decent wine.  But you can get that without having to stay here overnight.  I arrived to work being done on the outside of the hotel - apparently some rain damaged the drywall (huh?) so had to drive around the side to park where there is nobody to direct you to where the front desk is or heaven forbid be there to help you haul your bags up a flight of stairs.  Later I learned that the elevator down there wasn't just for parking - it could have taken me to the lobby so again it would've been nice if there was sombody down there to let a newcomer know what is where.  Not much in the way of hospitality - but then again this is a glorified Holiday Inn.  The lobby is okay in that it's very bright clean and somewhat hip.  The bar is off to the side where there is also a nice outdoor lounge.  Like other Yelpers I was a little confused by the two computers in the bar acting as the business center but whatever.  My room was pretty nice.  I liked the retro mid century look and feel.  This hotel's big selling point was the hard wood floors but in my opinion the floors were a HUGE mistake.  Firstly they are cheap laminate not hard wood and anybody can tell.  But worst of all the floors make sound travel from room to room!  I was able to hear everything next to me and above me.  And on this random Wednesday night my floor and the floor above me was an all night party - I mean college kids running up and down the halls like crazy people doors slamming (and I mean SLAMMING) and what sounded like a game of marbles above my head  This went on until 4 in the morning..  I think that the low price point and hipsterish feel here makes it the perfect place for a twentysomething crowd but not a business traveler like me.  Free internet and parking does not make up for the circles under my eyes.  So bottom line is if I were 22 and partying with my friends this would be a fantastic hotel.  For work or a romantic weekend in Scottsale notsomuch.
pos	This is a car wash that I would highly recommend. They do a great job and pay attention to the details. It costs a little more at Hot Shots but it's worth it. It takes a bit more time too- but worth it. The main reason I would recommend this place- they do an outstanding job and are consistent every time.
neg	There are no car washes in the area except this one. You have to put exact change in the machine and it never takes bills. You have to go inside to get a code to use the wash which is inconvenient! Why doesn't the machine want to take your money I have no clue. This car wash could be making a lot of money given it's location but it's junk. I will never give this gas station my money again.
pos	Nadya is one of the nicest people you will ever meet.  Part of her personality is what kept me coming back.  Recently she altered a bridesmaids dress for my girlfriend and did a terrific job.  Flawless.  In years past she has altered all of my \"work attire.\"  I have since moved but whenever I return home if I ever need any work done I will bring it with.  Nadya you are a wonderful person and any recommendation I can send your way I will!
neg	It's about $30/person and the portions are small so you will probably feel hungry (and robbed) an hour later.   Unless of course you are my parents and had the raw sandwich. Then you will be up all night with food poisoning.
pos	Taylor's has such a refreshing cafe menu. I've been for breakfast far more often than lunch. I hope to try dinner soon b/c I think they feature live jazz on Wednesday nights.   I've never ever had a bad meal. In fact I always have a hard time deciding. Some highlights in my opinion are the huevos rancheros eggs Benedict (with a choice of meat) waffles & the Mexican omelet.   I never liked Bloody Marys until I had one at Taylor's! I tried a friend's once and have been hooked ever since! But if you want a less intoxicating beverage try the iced chai latte. Careful its so good you'll be ordering another before you know it!   Bon Appetite!
neg	The majority of reviewers don't lie....it really was that bad.  This event spread like wild fire I had family members and friends talking about this event from the get-go!   Me and my bf arrived around 130 to a stand still at the parking entrance cars in front of us were u-turning their way out of there so we did the same and parked in a nearby  field.   Walking up to the event the lines looked ridiculous. Come to find out I would wait over 2.5 hours at the taco truck. Not cool. I waited by myself while family and friends waited in other lines my sister's kids played corn hole and some chose not to wait in line at all and grab something on the way home.   The variety of games was the best part. Great FREE activities for all ages to take part in.  So food wise my tacos were good. Even though I arrived on an empty stomach the tacos weren't overly fantastic or even worth the wait. I got the veggie chicken and beef taco. I shared and we all agreed the chicken taco was the winner. Would I wait 2 hours for those tacos again....NOPE! My friends graciously shared their fried bread and funnel cake with the group and that was really good.  Wonderful idea poor execution. Maybe next time it will be better.
pos	LOVED THE SWITCH WITH JENNIFER ANISTON what is wrong with film critics today????
neg	I too am also a fan of other FOX concept resturaunts but Sauce was extremely disappointing. Had seen the location at the Scottsdale Water Front but never seemed enticed enough to enter until the other night. My cousin and I met up at a central location and unfortunately this seemed like the best option in the Norterra lot.  He had a pizza which for my opinion are over-priced for their quality and size. Their menu doesn't span much taste-buds but can get any general idea of a \"classy\" pizza across. It was burnt and too crispy even for just a plan pepperoni and cheese it was boring.  Torn between wanting some pizza and a salad I ordered their \"greek\"ish salad which was pretty good. Although it was delicious the salad was way to rich to eat entirely by one's self.    I was mostly turned off by their service of wine in what appeared to be a juice cup. Maybe thats fine for my kitchen but thats at home where it doesn't cost per glass. My Mom informed me later that in a juice cup is actually how they drink it ususally across the Atlantic. hmp didn't know that.   All in all don't think I'll be getting sauced with Sauce again.
pos	For so many reasons Costco is top notch but I'm going to review their Opto department. They are equally as stellar! Dr. Tieu is super friendly knowledgeable and very approachable. The retail part has the best pricing on contacts frames and lenses compared to any competitor. Lucky me they take my insurance and my yearly supply of contacts came to a big fat $0 after rebates. Always ask about rebates for contacts both the Dr office and the retail desk will usually have some that you can combine!
neg	Since we had such a great experience with the Kitchen we signed up with them for a few glass work (shower windows bla...) Trouble started when they were pushing us towards a design that they wanted to sell rather than what we wanted.. they were slowly nudging us towards that goal... I did price it from several other vendors and the estimate was close so we decided to go with Da Vinci; however several restimations and remeasurements later they called us and told us that the original quote cannot be honored anymore as they did not consider the materials we specifically asked for + they think they will have to demolish a portion of the stucco and rebuiild it in order for the window to fit. The new quote came about 7.5\% more than the original. But the whole experience left us with a bad feeling and we cancelled the remodel work.
pos	Great posole - and the kids love their bean and cheese burritos. That's all we have eaten no need to venture further on the menu. Great hangover food. The staff is always very friendly!
neg	Lisa you were VERY confrontational on the phone and assuring us that you were not responsible for any injuries. AGAIN he tried to tell her to stop scrubbing the side of his toe so hard and with her being hearing impaired (we were told that she was deaf not just hearing impaired) she was unable to hear. The damage had already been done. We were running late getting my daughter to the airport that day and he didn't let me know it was so bad until we got home. I am NOT the type of person who just sues every business that I come into contact with as a matter of fact I have never had a lawsuit against anyone in my life. We continued to watch the toe until it got so bad we had to go to the dr. I didn't rush right out and start trying to get ANYONE you or your insurance company to pay our bill. It wasn't until talking to you on the phone that I got upset. The way that you talked to me and I believe you were very well paid for your services that day. The way that you come across to your injured customers is inexcusible though. As for the day that this occured he did tell the woman working on my feet that it was hurting and she told him that he was just sensitive. I would warn anyone who is diabetic to go elsewhere. An injury of that magnitude could cause some serious health issues. My fiance and I are not out to make a quick buck on anyone I can assure you of that! As for sterilizing your instruments......apparently I am not the only one that have noticed the unclean practices that your salon is guilty of.  Look at the other comments below. An understanding business owner would have been nice you were on the verge of screaming at me on the phone. I live in Fountain Hills and can't rush right back especially after the way that you talked to me on the phone. I can appreciate you contacting your insurance agent but as of now we refuse to deal with you and will only work with your agent. BEWARE OF THIS SALON!
pos	Put it this way: Every guest I have in Phoenix I force to get the Monte Cristo at Morning Glory. It is just that good.
neg	What's going on with the food here? Is there new owners? The food seems to be getting less tasty each time I come here. The beef for the green burrito is not the same the cheese (white) is horriible. Taste like cafeteria or hospital food. I hope the owner didn't sell and now some cheap owner are buying food now. I used to give this place a 5 star and now I would have to grade them as a 1 star until they improve the quality of there food.
pos	My fear and avoidance of the dentist has been building for years. However I simply couldn't put it off any longer. With trepidation I scheduled an appointment at Downtown Dental and promptly received an email back with available times. I went in not knowing what to expect. Not only had the staff already found my insurance information they made a point to call me by the name I go by rather than my formal name and that put me at ease. I sat down with Heather the hygienist and she was so warm and friendly that I instantly felt fine confessing to her my fear of the dentist. She allayed my concerns and told me not to worry. There was no guilt trip for not flossing or drinking too much soda which is always annoying. Then the scary part... the dental work. It was uncomfortable and I hated it but soon it was over it wasn't that bad and I felt a thousand times better. Dr. Berschler came over and examined me and pointed out a few cavities we needed to take care of. Then the even scarier part (or so I anticipated)...the price! But I was pleasantly pleased and relieved that the total cost after insurance was literally thousands less than I'd been quoted by a dentist a year ago to take care of my problems. In fact the total cost is very reasonable; this isn't a dentist looking to take advantage of you. I couldn't have been more pleased and delighted at the friendliness and helpfulness of everyone in the office. The convenient downtown location only makes it better. I will never go to another dentist again and I'm actually looking forward to my next appointment. I can't recommend this office enough.
neg	Went here on a Groupon and had a terrible experience.   After waiting 15 min for a table to open up waited another 10 for menus flagged down the waitress asked for water waited another 10 for water she shoved water glasses on our table left waved her down said she'd be right over she seated menu-ed and watered a group of four that had just arrived.   With the already horrendous service we figured service would be faster if we ordered items we could cook on the table top. When we the food arrived we received only two sets of dishes and silverware for 4 people.  The remainder of our meal our server never stopped by after trying to wave her down for one thing after another I resorted to going behind the counter myself even taking their water pitcher to refill our waters.
pos	This review if for their happy hour because that's all that I've experienced.  Love that they have happy hour all night on Sundays and Mondays.  I live close by and used to frequent Wildfish often for happy hour.  I usually get the crab cake and lobster bisque.
neg	Don't waste your time at this store .
pos	Good food
neg	Ordered the pasta bread bowls. Got one with chicken the other mac and cheese. Chicken was raw and mushy on one and the other had no sauce and the pasta was hard. like a rock
pos	Let me tell you about my first crush in Phoenix. It happened to me when I least expected. I was sitting at my small cubicle during my first job. Birthday cake graced the break room practically everyday but today was different. When I walked inside to sing an out of key version of the birthday song to my coworker I noticed a masterpiece in front of my eyes. A white cake topped with the freshest of fruit and the creamiest of white chocolate morphed into a piece of artwork. One bite into the white cake filled with fresh strawberries and I was in lust. It later turned into love and I've been happy every since.   I silently thank the coworker who introduced me to Honey Moon Sweets because I can't imagine life without knowing about this sweet Phoenix treat. Over the years Honey Moon Sweets has been my go-to bakery for a special occasion. I've purchased the \"basic\" cake for birthday parties. Let me just note here that a basic cake from Honey Moon Sweets is practically a masterpiece in any other bakery's mind. When planning my sister's baby shower I knew exactly where to go. I wanted the perfect cake and a work of art to grace the baby shower table. And behold the Honey Moon Sweets baby cake. It was three tiers blue with rattles pacifier building blocks a crib a teddy bear...you name it filling the top. Some of the pieces were frosting creations and some were real toys. It was almost too gorgeous to eat but we couldn't resist it so enjoyed every bite. It was just as good as it looked if not better. Honey Moon Sweets does a fabulous job of using the freshest of ingredients and you can tell upon the first bite. The scariest part of this cake adventure was the travel time from the bakery to the Biltmore for the baby shower. One wrong move and the cake would have been toast so be prepared to move lightly with this cake in hand. As you can imagine cakes from Honey Moon Sweets are not budget-friendly but for what you get from the cake it's reasonably priced. Just save your coins for a special occasion because it's worth it. I promise.
neg	The service was horrible! Our food was wrong when it came out and they acted as if we did wrong for calling them out on it. The music was too loud. I definitely will not be going back
pos	Food is outstanding! Rebecca rocks!!!!!!
neg	I came to test-drive a car and all of the questions I asked the salesman read the answers directly off the sticker. Since I am a literate person that wasn't necessary nor was it relevant as the questions I had about the vehicle didn't have answers that could have been found on the sticker. Yeah I do my own research before I waltz into these places and when I ask questions I expect my \"expert\" sales guy to answer them as he is supposed to know what he's selling right? I had to leave.  The next day Salesguy Einstein called me. And then a few days later. And again a few days after that. I'll give him that for at least being persistent. But he thought the price was the problem - not the car itself which I decided I didn't like anymore after I drove it and he was leaving me these ridiculous messages about selling me a \"used Mercedes.\" It was all really annoying and embarrassing to listen to.
pos	I'm sure most people don't go to a fancy steak restaurant for the Mac 'n cheese but as a mac aficionado it's practically my duty. And the mac here well it's high quality. I like to order the lobster mac sans lobster (not a big fan of seafood) which without the seafood is actually quite inexpensive. Now be warned this is real heavy mac 'n cheese. It's so cheesy and thick and delicious; don't plan on being able to wiggle out of your booth any time soon after eating it.
neg	slow very slow.  you would think for what they charge they would move a little faster. slow sloowww sllloooowwww.
pos	FEZ should stand for Fabulous Exotic ZExperience. I was planning on making it here for ages but couldnt until I found out the new metro rail is ride outside!! I needed a quiet place to read and was much obliged when they turned off all music by my request.  I was able to read my Nancy Bartholomew novles with great intensity. The staff left me alone for hours and the intoxicating rosemary smell really opened my buds. The atmosphere is definatly trendy After I finnaly soaked it all in I would def give this place 5 stars although I didnt try the food or bar.
neg	this place plainly sucks unless you have not taste for great Mexican food than you should go here.  The food was discussing and the black beans were way undercooked which he said that's because they were for the salad ( I want them cook even for my salad) nothing like a cold crunchy bean. The salsa was way to runny and had no flavor but the chili powder or what ever was it in. It's not worth the price they want...GROSS GROSS GROSS
pos	Better than Starbucks anyday!  The staff encourage their customers to get creative and provide new drink suggests to add to their list such as \"The Annihilator\".. My personal Favorite: \"The Cookie with a little raspberry\"
neg	Chicken thigh and leg came medium rare. Entres were lukewarm. Apppetizers were incosistent. Pork shoulder was cooked at too high a temp and not long enough stringy and dry. Beans were not cooked long enough. Fire alarm went off twice during meal and slow service with attitude. Carnitas tacos were ok. Terrible experience pretty much ruined our dinner look elsewhere for good mexican.
pos	Get ready to get meat drunk then fall into a meat coma!! Although this is not a nationwide chain this is what a chain restaurant can and should be it's great. You begin with an immaculate salad bar. Definitely the best one I have ever seen or tasted for that matter. Hell you have to love a salad bar that has a whole wheel of Parmesan cheese for you to enjoy. Enough with the salad lets talk about the star of the show the meat!! Transcendental might be too strong of a word but it is pretty damn close.  It is endless amounts of meat prepared 15 different ways all seasoned perfectly. You have to love something that is seasoned so well that if adding salt or pepper to it at the table would over season it. This place is pretty much a buffet that comes to you and after trying several meats its great because you don't want to move lol. And the best part is is that you tell them when to come to you!! I could go on and on but if you have about 60 bucks to spend and want to enjoy a great meal just go here and leave in physical pain from over eating like I do!!
neg	Let me preface my review by stating a few facts.  #1 My boyfriend and his family are Chinese and they were dining with me.  #2 The aforementioned Chinese people in my party ordered everything for us in the spirit of authentic Chinese cuisine.  #3 I put on a happy face and ate as much rice as I could to fill up.  :)  I like to start any decent meal with a good hand-washing especially when eating with my Chinese in-laws when they're in town from China.  I went into the bathroom at Diamond's and I almost hurled.  I am a mortician and around putrid smells every day of my life so for the smell of a bathroom to turn my stomach is reeeally saying something.  I felt obligated to stay and eat.  I left the bathroom and used antibacterial hand sanitizer instead.  :(  So the food began to appear.  We ordered a big pot of oolong tea to accompany our meal.  We were warned that it along with the glasses of water on our table was tap water.  The steamed white rice was fine and dandy and I ate most of it.  We got dungeness crab served chopped up but still in the shell and smothered in a brown gravy sauce that was none-too-tasty and killed the delicious crab taste.  We also had lobster that was similarly served chopped into pieced and smothered in sauce with the meat still inside.  This method of serving made it difficult to handle the food without getting your hands dirty including serving it to yourself from the lazy susan.  We also had cod with all the bones in it and the eyeballs still in its head completely intact.  I did not even taste it as I've had some bad experiences with fish bones.  The rest of the table ate the whole thing including the fish brain and eyeballs and cheeks.  *shudder*  Just a matter of personal preference but I can't do that.    All in all I would never go back.  Ever.  And I'd advise anyone with a weak stomach or a strong sense of smell to avoid this place at all costs.  Again this is simply my preference and opinion.  But I like to taste my food not just the seasoned gravy thrown onto it.  And the smell... oh good heavens!  Check please!
pos	Yum! I was a fan of Grimaldi's...but this place surpasses them! We had half chicken tuscana (garlic cream sauce) and half chicken artichoke (pesto sauce). Amazing! Great flavors! Usually I'm a fan of ranch on pizza fan (don't hate)--not needed here! Comes with the traditional crust which was really enjoyable but also available w/thin crust or wheat crust ($2 extra for wheat). Server (Zach) was nice offered suggestions and was on top of things. Kind of soft spoken given the tv's and other restaurant noise. Hostess seemed like she was pretty excited to be there and everyone was polite. Prices weren't too bad--$18 for a large pizza $8 for an individual. Variety of toppings salads appetizers calzones and drinks. Beers ranged from $3.75-$5 for the 16 oz.  Excited to go back and try some more pizza!
neg	I had a stand by appointment for a certain day which gets you a cheaper trip charge.  They did not show up that day and asked me to reschedule so I did.    Now I understand why they charge a trip charge it's because they are so overpriced that i'm sure that a lot of people send them away once they hear what they want to charge.  It was about double what another company quoted me without charging me a trip charge.  I had to pay $49 for the service guy to come to my house and show me their outrageous prices because they wouldnt give me a quote over the phone.  Their price list is a no fuss one price only so I really don't understand why they couldn't give me a quote over the phone.  The trucks are really nice looking though!  The service guy that came to my house was nice and knowledgeable.
pos	I cannot recommend Phoenix Knife House enough.    There are very few places where you can go and physically put your hands on so many different Japanese knives which is obviously key in any knife purchase.  If you've ever spent hours in the kitchen doing prep and chopping blisters are a very real possibility if the knife doesn't fit.  I've discovered over the last several years of cooking at home that I prefer a lighter and bolster-less knife for high speed chopping which ultimately led me back to PKH for a purchase.  Last year I purchased a Fujiwara 150mm petty for less than $60 and it's been a great knife; my girlfriend also likes it because it's light and maneuverable.  She bought me a Misono UX10 for my birthday which will ultimately replace my Henckels for most uses.  Bottom line go in tap into Eytan's knowledge of the knives (and care and maintenance) and get better tools for the job.  It's well worth it.  I bring all my kitchen knives here to get sharpened either by hand or on the grinding wheel.  Today I had four knives sharpened three on the wheel one by hand and two with tip damage.  Total cost = $13.    Bonus: purchases are tax free.  Highly recommended.
neg	Three different occassions I have gone to purchase items at this location and all three times they were out of stock. The third time I even called in advance and was told the merchandise I was looking for was in stock. The clerk when I asked wouldn't even go in the back to see if there was additional supply that hadn't been put on the shelves. These were not \"on sale\" items - I was looking for every day computer and/or video cables and components. Save yourself a trip: Make the trip to the Best Buy in Surprise or to the one on I-17 & Thunderbird.
pos	WOW what can I say... our friends have eaten here for years and we finally got to eat at Don and Charlie's for the first time in all the years that we have been coming to Spring Training.    We had an excellent dinner i was in the mood for fish and had the Macademia crusted Halibut.... WONDERFUL!!!!! My hubby had the prime rib and finished off every last juicy bite... the scalloped potatoes were the BEST I have ever had at any restaurant.  Must make this one of our usual stops during our yearly visit to Az.
neg	I've been using this \"service\" for two years and I kept expecting it to get better but it never has. For some reason that's beyond my understanding they can't seem keep their website up to date based on their current stock.  It seems to me that since the whole premise of this service is that you can order groceries ONLINE that they should at least have the site current.  That's a minor inconvenience unless you're missing the ingredient you need to make your planned meal or you don't have body wash etc.  If you're the type of person who likes to live on edge never knowing if the items you ordered are going to arrive this might be the perfect service for you.  You might even find it exciting!  If so then there you go you can thank me later for the tip.  This is all sort of annoying but wasn't a deal breaker for me what is a deal breaker is that recently we've occasionally not received our orders at all.  There have been several occasions where they over book their drivers and we don't find out until 10pm that our order won't be arriving or even once their system accidentally deleted my entire order.  Keep in mind that if you want to schedule a redelivery the next day (and you have a job so you need an evening appt) you'll need to allow them a 4 hour window to fit you in which means if you had plans that evening their shot. All of sudden this service that is supposed make my life so much easier is more of a hassle then driving to the store. I would avoid it.  Maybe one day they'll figure it out or better yet maybe Fry's will get on board and do it right. That'd be nice.  Oh PS their customer service call center sucks
pos	Saw this place in the Yelp email.  Needed to take my son to Toys R Us to use a gift card and it occurred to me that Habit Burger was right there so I suggested we have lunch there rather than the usual McD's.  I temped him with the offer of a chocolate shake.  I was amazed with the cleanliness and brightness of this place.  There was a line when we got there but it moved quickly.  The tables were packed but we managed to snag a 2-top pretty soon after getting in line.  My son had the kids grilled cheese meal (something you don't find at your standard fast food place) and I had a charburger.  We shared his fries and the shake.  OMG - the burger was heavenly!  The roll gets a little grill to it so it has a little crunch on the inside.  It was not greasy at all just tasty and soooo good!  The fries were equally ungreasy and good - crunchy too.  The chocolate shake - my son only had about 3 sips which left me to drink the rest of it (dang it) - was absolutely delish.  And the prices were outstanding!  Its a good thing there isn't a Habit Burger closer to my house.  I'd eat there all the time!  Five Guys?  Forget em!!!
neg	Went for coffee at this McDonalds today.  Three of their rising stars were in the drive through line eividently the microphone at the menu had the day off.  With three of their brightest doing the work of a sign and a microphone the line was backed up and getting worse by minute.  The courtesy of the staff was beyond lacking and the dolts who lined up for McDONALDS was scary.  I went inside to get my coffee having given up on the \"helpful trio in the drive through\" only to be met by the team who weren't good enough to qualify for the parking lot gig.  I would recommend dumpster diving over going to this restaurant.  Unless you are in a coma or have nothing else better to do I would avoid this place.  WOW.
pos	We recently had a pleasure trip to AZ and I booked at the Fairmont Princess and I must say I made an AWESOME choice!  - Room was I guess a standard King but it was so large and spacious with a couch and seating area as well as a very comfortably appointed bath and patio. The decor looked fresh and new as well. Very contemporary. Lovely. We were in building C and overlooked the rose/aroma garden which was quite quiet and pretty. Might have been a little better to overlook the lagoon with the firey fountain but we were pleased none the less. - Pools were the best. We swam in the main south pool the east pool and used the slides the kids area as well. Did a lot of night swimming as it was hot and gotta tell you...night swimming rules! We rarely get to do where I live. - Restaurants and bars were very good...if a bit pricey...as well. We had dinner at Bourdon Steak by Michael Mina which was very tasty and nice ambiance. Ate at Hacienda Restaurant and also at the bar at an outside table. Kinda liked eating at the bar better. Yum of the drinks.  - Great trip....great place...we will be back!
neg	One of these just opened by my house and my husband and I were really excited to try it because everyone says such great things. I was so disappointed! I agree that the fries were limp and I'm a crispy fry lover. The burger tasted good but I felt pretty ill shortly after eating it. Not food poisoning ill - more like over-greased ill. I don't really eat fast food so maybe that's it but I will not be returning.
pos	My husband called the chicken fajita burrito one bad ass burrito. The carne asada burrito and quesadilla were equally yummy. Nice stop for a quick bite.
neg	So my car had been vibrating for about a week and I thought I needed an alignment so I took it to the nearest place I could find that did alignments after price checking around.  Turns out their prices are about average for that kind of thing so I went to them.   After they looked it over they said my steering gear assembly was bad and that my tires were moving almost 4 inches independently of one another!  Because of this the alignment wouldn't be any good until I got it fixed.  They also said my front 2 tires were bad and needed to be replaced (which was true I knew that for a while).  Safe to say I was scared for my car!  They quoted me $921.60 for everything. Luckily I never do anything without a second opinion so I dropped in on my family mechanic Bill at Black Canyon Automotive in North Phoenix while I was in the neighborhood the next day.  He put it on the lift he brought me under the car with him and he pointed out that there was nothing wrong with the steering gear the tires were moving perfectly with one another and an alignment wasn't the issue.  The vibration was from a bubble in my front driver side tire because one of the tires belts was broken.  I went to Discount Tire got 2 new tires and all was well for only $200! Thinking back I realize how bold faced the lie Purcell's fed me was.  I mean if my tires were moving 4 inches independently of one another the car couldn't make it out of the parking lot forget about slight vibrations over 65MPH! These guys are liars and crack pots!  Avoid them!
pos	I'm a girl who knows her way around a donut. The boyfriend and I would usually venture out to Chandler to get our Bosa Donut fix so I was super excited to discover they had opened a location closer to home. I was also super scared for my waistband.  Bosa is hands down the best donut shop in the Valley. Not that there is a ton of competition but still. They're really good. They offer a wide variety from your classic cake to puffy glazed filled to fritters. My favorite is the glazed twist. So chock full of sugary sweetness my teeth kinda hurt just thinking about it. Their donuts are always fresh and they keep a good stock available so you're not stuck with only the coconut donuts.  I brought in a bunch to work the other day and my co-workers gobbled them up. Who doesn't love being handed a frosted piece of donut heaven?  I'm sure I will become a regular of the Tempe Bosa in no time.
neg	Had to wait in line over an hour.  Meanwhile other car rental counters were open and available.  When I finally got to talk to a clerk that spent 15 minutes trying to upsell me after I had prepaid for everything online.
pos	Next Door Realty is fantastic!  Daradee Murray handled the short sale of my home recently and the entire transaction went unbelievably smooth.  From start to finish she was an excellent communicator.  She took all of our concerns into account and made the process a breeze for us.  I would highly recommend Next Door to anyone looking to buy or sell a home.  The personal attention you receive is unparalleled!
neg	nasty!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
pos	We happened upon this place on Sunday. We had our 2 1/2 year old with us and she was yelling about being hungry. We quickly ducked into Zinburger. All three of us had burgers. The kid's burger was huge and it came with fries. We also ordered the sweet potato fries. The people around us had milkshakes and they looked delicious. I also noticed fried zucchini and figure next time I'll order those instead of fries.   We were in a rush and had something at 6 pm. We told the waiter we were in a hurry. He was great friendly and accommodating. We were seated next to the hostess stand and my daughter kept trying to engage the folks standing there. Everyone was so nice.   My constructive feedback would be that I ordered my burger medium well and I received it medium rare. It still tasted yummy and I ate it. Had it been served that way to my hubby - he would not have been able to stomach the red juice flowing from the burger.
neg	I used to come here on occasion and always had a blast; HOWEVER this time around has put me off forever.  Went to eat with friends; waitress I found to be rude as she acknowledge my guy friends and barely made contact with me throughout the night.  Sat in my chair did not look at me nor apologize when I came back to find her sitting there beside my significant other.  Odd...  Since I found her demeanor to be lacking and found her to be rude and short I tipped her 10\%; which she in turn told me that was \"shitty\" and proceeded then to call me a \"bitch\" several times.  I kept my composure while she continued to have issues with her anger and I asked to speak to the manager.  I knew from her tone that the manager would not be helpful at all and I was correct.  He was insincere and unhelpful.  The waitress should be reprimanded or sent to anger management as this is the first time I ever had such an experience especially being called names.  Talk about immature.
pos	Addicted to duck fat fries!  Curry mayo is a perfect complement to duck fat fries.  Did I mention how awesomely delicious duck fat fries are?  You know what forget that I said anything about duck fat fries.  They only make a limited amount and I don't want you to go.  Nope.  Don't go.   I guess I should mention the rest of the menu.  Everything is awesome.  Nutella rules!  Seriously.
neg	Beautiful decor ... poor service.   We made a reservation for which we were only 10 minutes late for due to traffic. We were told that it would be a 15-20 minute wait for a table. After waiting for 40 minutes (it is 730 pm now) a hostess told us it would be another 15-20 minute wait.    They did offer a sit at the bar if we wanted to eat there and that they were 'very sorry'. Did I mention that it was a Tuesday night? We drove all the way from Mesa and it was my birthday! We got a babysitter for the night and they couldn't give us a table!!  I'm pregnant! No I don't want to sit at the bar in a stool after watiing for 40 minutes!!!! So we left. After waiting all that time. And we still have to pay valet.    Save your money. There are other fine steakhouses in Scottsdale.
pos	This is another work lunch takeout place for me and it always does me right. I always get the Jerk Chicken bowl with rumbi rice and have never been disappointed by it. Good flavor lots of chicken and veggies and rumbi rice is simply delicious. I personally like to add hot sauce and also sometimes splurge on a cup of tortilla soup -which is pretty freakin great. There's alot of cheese on top of the soup so lactose intolerants beware!
neg	Lost my tire center cap broke my radiator hose. Nice work otherwise.
pos	I seriously can't get enough of this spicy goodness! All I ever wanna go is SIAM and nowhere else. I've been to so many Thai restaurants in AZ the past month and NOTHING compares to Siam! BEEF MA SA MAN curry is so addictingly amazing and the pad thai is always cooked to perfection. I'm actually craving it as I type this.
neg	I used to love shopping at Sunflower!!  The produce was great.. with a nice selection of organic and organic binds... the prices were good..cashiers were nice!!!  WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO THIS STORE!!!  First the produce was old..lettuce was old and soggy in the container the onion I bought yesterday sprouted!! The kale was obviously old and yellow!!  I started returning things..something is wrong at this store..Then I was in over the weekend..t only got a few things..and went to the bind with organic Apricots..the bind was half full..I took some out..AND THEN I NOTICED INSECTS FLYING AROUND INSIDE THE BIND!!!  Thats it I'm done..and will take my business elsewhere..
pos	For some reason these self serve frozen yogurt places have popped up all over the valley and they are all very similar. What I like about this place are the choices. I usually don't have any issues I'm a mint chocolate chip man and that's typically what I order. My girlfriend on the other hand likes to mix it up and try new flavors and toppings. This place has the largest selection of flavors and toppings of any of the self served frozen yogurt places we've been too. For those of you who are calorie conscience as I am they post the nutrition facts right buy the flavor so you know exactly what you're getting.
neg	what is this filth that i am eating?  had it delivered ... but whoops!  forgot the rice.  how do you forget the rice?  anyhow the peanut sauce was deplorable ... it was literally the consistency of water i could pour it down the drain - and did.  the panang curry was the same -- more like soup and less like sauce.  this place is easily in the bottom 3 of thai places i have ever eaten at.
pos	John did a fantastic job on figuring out my overheating issue on my Infiniti after Grelichs failed to fix my car properly. John is more than fair with there pricing and are extremely knowledgeable. He has a customer for life from me.
neg	Horrible!! I took US Airways coming back home from a business trip in which I had to take connecting flights from DCA to PHX to SFO. My flight was supposed to leave at 7:30pm from PHX and when I go to check-in (upon arrival from DCA) they tell me that my bags from my connecting flight were put on a later flight at 11:00 pm! I even showed them my confirmation/receipt printed out and they told me they couldn't do anything because my bags were put on a later flight to SFO.    To top it all off instead of the nice aisle seat I originally requested on a bigger plane I got stuck boarding a mini one with a seat in Siberia next to the lavatory door that wouldn't close and the attendant had to use a pen to keep it shut during take-off. My seat was soiled and the window cover was cracked and you couldn't even pull it down because it was being held up by a crumpled piece of newspaper. It was so uncomfortable and dirty I didn't even want to lean back into my seat. I almost cried. I've sat on cleaner seats in the BART. HORRIBLE!! Never again.
pos	The obsession started about 2 yrs ago and I haven't looked back since... Started with getting them catered for lunch then a trip here or there to the restaurant. SO. GOOD. The bread is amazing but the love sweat tears and what ever else they pop in there is addicting. Hmmm now I am wondering what it is they put in there?? Anyway I won't think too long and hard about that one. But tomorrow I'm definitely heading back for the Vermonter gotta feed the addiction.
neg	Since we always come here for happy hour I thought to stop by for lunch one day for sushi.  Um yeah there aren't very many sushi specials for lunch.  The only thing on the menu was 4 pcs sushi with soup for $10.  The menu was puzzling - had clam chowder burgers and non-existent sushi options.  Very disappointing.
pos	If you're at all a \"Foodie\" you can't come to Phoenix or anywhere within 50 miles and not visit Matt's Big Breakfast.  The wait outside is just part of the ambiance and culture of this tiny little place.  I hope they don't very enlarge this place....it would so spoil it.  Food....have anything.  Its all cooked to perfection with love and kindness from a kitchen staff that really cares about freshness.  My personal fav's are the Waffle and Bacon and the multi grain toast with the fresh jam typically made locally....changes frequently.   This was on Diner Drive-ins and Dives a few years ago and its still the same bustling place as when Guy was there.  Side note...this was way cool.  On our last visit there were 4 of us and if you've been here you know there are only a couple of tables that seat 4.  So we're waiting outside when the server comes out hands us menus takes our orders.  When we're seated about 15 min. later our food was delivered within minutes of being seated.  Helped us get in and out and helped them move a table.  Much appreciated service.
neg	customer service stinks- enough said.  i asked my doctor for a dermatologist referal and was given this guy.  in doing my own research i couldn't find a web page for them besides a single page with no contact information.  i called and after immediately being put on hold for 5 minutes i got hung up on.  yeah i really want to go there now- heck i don't even trust my primary care doctor after this
pos	What can I say... we eat here once a week for lunch cuz we can walk here. We come here for happy hour twice a week cuz we can walk here.   So yeah it's pretty convenient... but we STAY here after hours to play poker because the servers know us by name and the food is priced right and the poker crowd is really cool and it's a great place to eat-n-learn.  And we LOVE Tony because that guy says hello to EVERY CUSTOMER EVERY TIME.   Trust me on this one... jump off the freeway for happy hour... you'll know what I mean when Tony says hello to you too.  PS get the three meat calzone. You look great and can afford the calories...
neg	It's been a while since I have eaten here but when I last went I had a horrific experience.  I got the chicken salad which was full of dark meat bone gristle skin etc.  I had to run to the bathroom and get rid of it.  When I returned to the table I calmly explained to the manager I was unhappy with the food (you could see that the quality of food was really low.)  The manager was rude and I had to argue with him to remove the meal and my drink from the bill.  I would think that after a customer was caused to vomit he would have already taken my meal off the bill...at the least.  I'd never go back.  I wrote a letter to the head chef of the chain and copied the manager and got absolutely no response from either.  Poor food.  Poor service.  Poor management that goes all the way up to the highest level.
pos	What an awesome business! Friendly knowledgable people that make you feel like family when you come in. I can't to tell you how refreshing it is to walk into an audition and feel welcomed! Auditioning is a scary enough experience without feeling intimidated by your environment and the people auditioning you. Here you'll find great people who love what they do and have an extensive amount of knowledge and experience. Oh and I also recommend taking one of Faith's workshops... I took one recently and I learned some very valuable tools that will definitely help me in future auditions :D
neg	If you live near fresh water (San Francisco Seattle) don't eat fish here. Everything - EVERYTHING is frozen. Sand dab no - scallops - no prawns eh no- even frying it didn't help. just don't eat fish in AZ.  Veggies are good  Wait staff is good Mojito was GREAT - not a mix
pos	Delicious food and excellent staff make this small French restaurant worthy of five stars. We began with a glass of fabulous wine that we brought (it is byob) and ordered the onion tart as an appetizer. The taste of the leeks coupled with the cheese buttery and flaky pastry made this one of the most tasty ways to start a meal. I ordered the marinated chicken. This dish came with a juicy chicken breast with a light pesto sauce mashed potatoes and sauteed spinach. The flavors intermingled to create a sensuous bite time and time again. My girlfriend got the filet which was juicy and flavorful and came with perfectly roasted potatoes and tomatoes. For dessert we ordered the tart of the day which was fruit and coconut cream on top of a shortbread-tasting tart. Just delicious. The service was wonderful very efficient and friendly. It is not cheap it was $99 for the appetizer two entrees and dessert...but for the experience and the exquisite flavors I will go back for any special occasion... guaranteed.
neg	Why did I agree to go here? BLAAAAAAH! Even for fast casual Japanese food it sucked. I got the low-carb (no rice) teriyaki salmon bowl. The vegetables _ a mix of cabbage broccoli and carrots _ had no flavor whatsoever. It was like hospital cafeteria veggies. Ever hear of salt or using a flavored broth? The sauce on the salmon was OK but once you eat off the top layer no flavor inside at all. It was not worth $6.62 or whatever the price. I rarely go so far as to say \"Oh I could have cooked better at home\" but in this case it's true. One of the worse meals I can remember having. And their shiu mai dumplings obviously frozen and then cooked because a) way too labor-intensive otherwise and b) that had more flavor. How can it be next door to Cherry Blossom Noodle? I need a good meal to counteract this.
pos	Everything you need to feel like you opened a time capsule!  Place makes me want to have 5 houses to slather in vintage odds and ends.  The place is very well organized and themed which makes it easy to find items while you're on the hunt.
neg	Bad service. Really really bad. Food is okay
pos	bank building turn to a coffee beanery is way cool.   plenty of seats to settle yourself in and crack open your books and do your homework. the free wi-fi is helpful too but the connection lags sometimes when their a bunch of people hopping online to check their myspace.  it gets chilly at time i suggest bring a sweater if you're the unlucky one seated underneath the A/C vent.   the vault room is great when trying to escape the loud chatter in the main room just don't forget to turn off your cell phone when you're in there it's kind of rude...  if you wanna be shaking out of your pants i suggest the Iced Toddy. it's strong and it should keep you up all night if you have a big project the following day.  customer service is very nice and helpful.
neg	Had gone to firestone in Tucson while in college figured I could trust the company/brand in Scottsdale. 1year old civic 15k miles...went in for oil change and was given a $600 list of recommended services.I declined (thank g.) & and took it to Honda for my next oil change (4k miles later) everything was fine. Firestone lost my business. Sucks most bc zipps is right next door. Boo!!!!
pos	I think its about time I wrote a formal review for this establishment considering I have recently bestowed it as \"My Favorite Restaurant\" - that's a big title to carry.   I often judge Mexican restaurants based solely on their chips and salsa and Gallo Blanco passes that test.  They have a delicious green tomatillo and smoky chipotle - as well as the typical hot sauce and fresh pico.  Their chunky guac is delish and summery as they put orange slices in it.   Although the chiccharon gets a lot of buzz (I think it taste like Cheez-Its) their best appetizer is the Elote - grilled corn-on-the-cob with cheese on it. It literally melts in your mouth! Oh and it doesn't get stuck in your teeth like most corn-on-the-cobs tend to.   The orange cake is AMAZING and reminds me of my beloved red velvet - except you know orange.   I love everything about this restaurant - salsas food drinks atmosphere prices entertainment (on Wednesday!) - they just need to get rid of that damn giant ugly silver air conditioning thing they have running through the bar.
neg	I wish I had read the reviews ahead of time about being upsold insurance you didn't want because that's exactly what happened to us.  I complained when we returned the car and of course they refused to take it off.  In 30 years of renting cars I have always DECLINED the insurance and that's exactly what I thought I had done on Monday Jan. 2 2012 but Dollar is apparently making too much money on the insurance to hear you when you say \"Decline.\"  I will NEVER do business with them again.
pos	Bobby Q is GREAT! We enjoyed EVERYTHING: brisket sandwich baby back ribs brisket with spicy sauce - yum!!! Blooming onion - just right! Baked potato crunchy on the outside and fluffy on the inside  withe barbeque pork and the fixings......mmmmmmmm!  Our waitress perfect - Go - now!
neg	Victoria secret Tempe market place sucks!if you hurt your self there they don't care they care more about selling you bras rather than asking and see if you are ok instead of are you ok? Can I order you bra online? Ah! HELLO! I can order my own bra online! I made a complaint already ! 3 times people! Nobody called me ! I guess nobody gives a SHIT!Z!
pos	This store made me feel like I had died and went to fabric heaven.  There is just so much beautiful wonderful amazing fabric.  I dropped a pretty penny- but I've already used some of my perfect fabric for great projects.  The place is clean the staff is super friendly and patient- especially with newbies like me.  When I brought 10 different reams of fabric up and had to stop and really think about how much I needed- patience came with a smile.  It seems like everything (even the high end designers) are around $10/yard.  If you get bogged down with all the fabric that you are falling in love with they have a cute little table set up with these funny little signs that say \"get your paws off my fabric\" which made me chuckle.  Maybe I'm turning into an old lady who loves silly stuff like that.  Despite the somewhat sketchy location 35th Ave. Sew and Vac is my new go-to for fabric!
neg	It's hard to review food when the cleaning chemicals are so strong you can't eat.  The section I was seated in was being cleaned with strong disinfectant I was asked to move my feet so they could clean the floor under my table but they swabbed my feet too!!!  I was here for food not a shoe swabbing.  Well I got sick from the disinfectant paid for my food and left.  Yep they make you too sick to eat then charge you for food that hasn't been delivered!!!  So I can't comment on the food but the cleaning products stunk and left stains on my shoes.   Not really the experience I was looking for.
pos	Anyone who tells you this place isn't amazing is cu cu for coco puffs. The owners are equally amazing. They will remember you and tell you amazing stories and the cocktails are always amazing. My favorite is the lychejito made from lychee infused vodka made in house. The spring roll bar is amazing and they always change it up for me if I ask for substitutions. There really isn't anything on the menu that isn't good they offer everything from Vietnamese sammies to amazing clay pots. I always go for the soup but that hasn't stopped me from trying everything else. Everything is always fresh and delicious. Their happy hour is awesome as well.
neg	Read the reviews and went to the hidden gem for dinner tonight (Saturday night) and it was dark.  Either temporarily or permanently closed.  Call before you spend the effort...
pos	I originally came here because I heard they have a gluten free menu--i expected one or two pizzas probably cheese and one other choice. But they have a FULL menu of pizzas salads and appetizers that are gluten free. and they are DELICIOUS!   Pizza was my absolute favorite food in my past gluten-filled life. Anything from Slices to Pizzaria Bianco. I have tried gluten free pizzas almost everywhere you can find them and they are always too dry too thin too soggy or completely different flavor than what pizza crust should taste like.   Picazzo's gluten free pizza is delicious the crust is pretty thick and has a good texture not like a big saltine cracker as most places tend to be. the flavor is true to pizza crust! my friends even like it so much they will split a gluten free pizza with me instead of ordering 'regular' crust.  There is also a range of appetizers that are delicious caprese salad with gluten free bread and the spinach dip are my faves.   The employees are all very nice and aware of gluten intolerance--they check with you before they bring you additional food items or before putting GF and non-GF foods together in your to go box.   I love it. If you are gluten or wheat intolerant and  you like pizza this will be your new favorite place. Totally worth the drive and the money. But the prices are very reasonable for GF food!
neg	Sorry ... not impressed with the pizza ... greasy ... could not finish the 1 slice I ordered ... Salad was blah ... free popcorn had no taste no salt no butter ... blah ... not returning
pos	Mastro's serves up the best steak in Scottsdale.  They also offer delicious seafood and excellent side dishes.  Prices are steep. After 10pm this place becomes a pick up joint for gold digging women seeking sugar daddy's.
neg	As a New Yorker I'm always yearning for a good deli experience in the desert. After all my people wandered around one for 40 years. You'd think we could find a decent nosh!! Anyway this place ain't it. As pathetic as it sounds I still can't find anything better than Chompies and that's a pretty low bar to cross.   My wife and I took 4 of our 5 kids (oldest at UofA) and we were hopeful for a taste of NYC as we had been here for breakfast once before and it was decent. Our lunch experience was far from it.   I had the special - a skirt steak sandwich. My wife had a half chopped liver sandwich and a cup of soup (can't recall which one). Kids had bagels.   Portions were ridiculously small. There were 4 strips of steak on my bread. My wife had an ice cream scoop of chopped liver. Bagels were large but nothing special. Service was prompt but devoid of personality. Come on if you're gonna work at a deli at least give me a little attitude!   Anyway if you're Jonesing for deli avoid this place. It won't help.
pos	I will start this review off by saying that I would normally have given this place 4 stars but for a large dog-friendly patio and immediate water bowls the minute your dogs butt hits the ground they get the extra star.   We went today a Sunday and sat down next to people that had the exact same dog that we have (a female harlequin Great Dane) and knew that it was fate.  We sat by them because they seemed awesome and in great company the food flourished in my eyes.    They have a pretty decent beer selection they had my favorite Sonoran White Chocolate ale and my boyfriend had something he loved on tap called the Bell's Two Hearted Ale (but apparently it's an amazing IPA). I knew I'd love mine he LOVED his.  We had the Mac and Cheese which was awesome but not as amazing as others I've had.  So order it if your a Mac person but don't if you're not.    We had two sandwiches for dinner I had the Acapulco Cheesesteak (UNBELIEVABLE!!!!!!!!!!!)  and Seann had the RB&C (an equally impressive Roast Beef concoction). Those were both devoured with great beer and great conversation with others.  Lastly we had the Triple Chocolate Brownie per a recommendation from our fellow dog owner and it was delish.  VERY VERY chocolatey and too much food after an app a sandwich and two beers but it was definitely worth trying.  Overall the food would have gotten a four but the experience with cool people around us and a great waitress really sealed the 5 star deal.  Now being added into the rotation.  Thank you Main Ingredient! : )
neg	Went to Spotted Donkey today and sign says they are closed!
pos	Yummy yummy yummy! Absolutely loved it - kick back quiet people nice not crowded and breakfast was crazy yummy!
neg	Just gave another try last night to see if Saigon is worth to hold my heart but obviously it is not.   To be honest I've tried real authentic Vietnamese food so if you try the food and you think it's good - then you haven't tried the real food! Since they just changed the owner quantity is more matter than quality.  They just wanted to cook quickly serve quickly to meet the demand and if someone don't know the real taste then it's their lost!  Last night we had to wait more than 15mins for the food to come out. I ordered Pho Tai with beef on the side + xtra beef (because I'd prefer to eat them medium raw) and my bowl came out as a big disappointment: They didn't use eye round steak as advertising - they used some kinda different beef and it made me wanna vomit right in the first bite. I am not talking about the siracha I'm not talking about bean sprouts not about any other either - I'm talking about the broth. I just felt like I ate a bowl of boiling water with some MSG!  My friend ordered Mi Hoanh Thahn (egg noodles and wonton) - she let me try the broth and both of us agreed that the broth tasted like boil water plus some xtreme fish sauce!  I'm not even try to come back here in a mean while - I can get much more than I expected at other places.   I just feel bad for those who get deceived by the price and such.. bc they would never know they can enjoy something better than that!  Sorry Saigon but I need to cross your name out of my list!
pos	My boyfrind and I attended here this past weekend on Serptember 82012 to celebrate our one year anniversary. Every employee went out o their way to tell us Happy Anniversary. We were seated quickly after entering the restaraunt. Our waiter was knowledgeable friendly and very professional. We were given our own privacy to celebrate intimately. The food was amazing and we both enjoyed our selves so much!! Thank you Meling Pot. We are going to make you our annual celebration spot!!!
neg	Burrito after a few bites I discovered I had been chewing on a piece of what appeared to be plastic like cigarette clear wrapping the size of a playing card the food is always cold between the food being cold every time I get a burrito there and now foreign objects in the burrito! Come on its Arizona there's plenty of better places to get your burrito fix...
pos	Cute busy place in Central Phoenix. Not hiding behind gimmicks to make themselves authentic. Simple and sweet. Staff is well versed in Japanese food if you haven't had it in years ask. Great staff great food great times.
neg	Trying to shop at this store for a bra for my 80 year old mother was an exruciating and miserable experience. Troubles began when the salesperson insisted my mother be fitted for a masectomy bra when she hasn't had a masectomy ! When we tried to express our concerns about the poor fit of the bras they were giving her to try on the 2 staff that were present were unresponsive to our concerns and rude. Needless to say we won't be returning. I would advise potential customers to reconsider where they would purchase their lingerie unless they can fit their own bras and don't expect any customer service. The needs of the customer are not a concern for the staff at this place of business.
pos	In town for business and came to Pappadeaux's for dinner...what a great experience.  Hostess wait staff and servers were all outstanding.  The food was amazing.  Perfectly cooked vegetables to accompany the Costa Rican Mahi.  Ice cold beer on a hot 102 degree day was a welcome addition!  Although we later found out our waiter was in training (it was his first day) he was attentive professional and available to answer any questions we had.  Highly recommended.
neg	I ordered from hunan Chinese delivery last night and was not impressed at all! I was so dissapointed when I opened it all up. I had gone on here to find a good delivery and this place had good reviews so I thought I'd try it out.   The prices are good for what you all get but the quality of the food was terrible. The orange chicken was super soggy and so was the rice. I did enjoy the egg roll though. My husband ordered the teriyaki beef and didn't even want to touch it. He said looking at it just made him want to get sick. Def won't be eating the mounds of leftovers today...
pos	I've been to a ton of Pho places here in the valley and this is the best one I've been to by far.  The prices are reasonable and the Pho was fantastic.  The rolls were pretty good but not the best I've had around here (that honor belongs to Saigon Pho not too far from this place.  BBQ beef rolls there are fantastic but I digress).  I haven't tried anything else at Pho Van but it all looked pretty good too.    The place is super clean and the service was ridiculously fast (I don't know if it was just my luck or if that's a regular thing).  I want to come back but it's not close to my house.  However it's worth the drive if you ever get that Pho craving.
neg	I no like.  I thought the atmosphere was awful.  Too bright and hospital like for my tastes.  I thought the staff was incredibly snotty inept and downright rude.  I thought the wine selection left a lot to be desired.  It was cheap because it was happy hour.    We got the cheese plate only to discover that the cheeses were from Trader Joes cheese section and were rather... commercial and blah It also came with sliced pepperoni.  Pepperoni?  Really?  I just didn't like it. Which is truly a shame because I was hoping it could become my new wine happy hour staple.   But alas I'll keep searching....
pos	Count us in for a #5 Combo a Oaxaca Special & two hard tacos....maybe some chips and salsa to go!  Best Mexican fast food around..and cheap!  Always busy at lunch but they get through the orders in a timely manner.  Seating can be tricky so have one order and another stalk tables! :)  You can park behind the place and walk through the back door....little FYI.
neg	The BBQ sauce is ketchup-based and sickly sweet. The potato salad tastes like it has Thousand Island dressing in it instead of mayo or mustard. I exchanged the potato salad for \"BBQ pit beans\" it was so bad. The beans taste like pork & beans from a can with a few kidney and Lima beans thrown in for color. Who serves Lima beans with BBQ? Yuck. If you're from Texas or Kansas City don't waste your time or money. If I could give zero stars I would.
pos	My boss asked me to find someone to clean the office windows (about 50 large panes) inside and out so I got in touch with Brad.  He was very professional throughout the experience and his mastery of this craft is phenomenal.  The windows were crystal clear within a few hours; he did a very thorough job.  Punctual efficient and easy to work with--his rate was very competitive and his work is worth every penny!  The office looks brand new.
neg	I was on vacation in Gilbert and wanted to leave a bouquet of flowers for our hosts.  I found Lena's via google and called them at 9:00am.  I asked to order a bouquet that i saw on their web site.  They told me it wouldn't be ready until 2:00pm.  I had to catch a flight at 12:50 so I told them that wouldn't work for me and even explained I had a flight at 12:50pm.  I asked if they had any bouquets already prepared in the cooler and they said yes.  I told them i would take one from there and said I would be on my way to pick it up.  They told me no problem to come on down.    I arrived at 9:45am and waited quite awhile as there were a number of people picking up prom corsages/wristlets.  They were completely disorganized and couldn't fin people's orders.  One was completely wrong so they had to redo it.  When they finally got to me 15 minutes later the woman at the desk turned to the flower arranger and asked if she was done with my order.  The woman said no it says \"2:00pm\" on the order sheet.    At this point I was already late to pick up my family so I told them to forget it and walked out.  I realize they were busy with prom orders but they should have staffed the store accordingly.  I would advise people to order flowers elsewhere if they are in Gilbert AZ!
pos	Ladies in the flooring section are very knowledgeable and helpful.  Though I do think they are a bit understaffed they were gracious and friendly.  Fairly large in stock flooring section compared to other stores.
neg	I recently flew US Airways from Phoenix to Chicago. It was the bargain on Hotwire so that is what I went with. I cannot complain about the rate... $237 round trip is cheap these days. However you are nickel-and-dimed for luggage check-in a coke snacks etc. I limited myself  to just one small suitcase which added $15 each way. (Thankfully I did not exceed the luggage weight or there would have been another fee.) A second suitcase would have been an additional $25.  So fair experience overall HOWEVER I discovered that passengers can bring cats and dogs on the airplane. Maybe I have been living in a cave but how is this even possible? First of all I am severely allergic to cats and I know I am not the only one out there because that is a very common allergy. Guess where the little feline was?! You guessed it right under my seat. For whatever reason I seemed to not have much of an allergic reaction. I am not sure if it was the recirculated air in the airplane or what.   I did ask the flight attendant if they were indeed allowed. She replied with a plastic and enthusiastic smile \"Oh yes! We allow cats and dogs and have for quite some time.\" No doubt she probably had a cat at home. I inquired about the possibility of the animals peeing or worse! Again with the plastic smile she explained they are in carriers -- as if that solves this biological need. Really????  I don't know about you but I am not crazy about being trapped 10000 feet up having to smell cat urine on a 4-hour flight. How is that allowed? How does that meet health codes? Are other airlines allowing this too. Whasssuppp pussycat?!?!
pos	Just moved to AZ and this is my local Petco. Everyone's really helpful and friendly. We just took our dogs here to get groomed and they came back smelling fresh and looking clean.
neg	So......disappointed after everything I have heard about this place.  We have a great work team and we are always planning HH around Mill Ave. as we work in the vicinity.  So to get our group to stray and try something new we thought Thirsty Lion a few miles away Tempe Marketplace.  I was really excited about HH starting at 3pm  So at 3:30ish no one is there...few people at the bar the high tops all have a reserve sign.  First few team members to arrive try to get a seat for our group...and we are asked about  our reservations. WHAT! on a Tuesday?  All the high top seating are vacant.  Anyhow they did let us have one of the high tops.  So now we are ready to order our HH specials.  Remember....there is no one there.  It took forever to get our drinks they had nice options with their HH food menu so we order a couple appetizers.  They were really nothing special.  So I order the pretzel...looks interesting w/the beer batter sauce.  So I am waiting  waiting waiting....had to order a wine...I'm waiting waiting waiting.  Finally I asked where is my wine...oh it's coming.  How about my pretzel order.....the waitress forget to put the order in.  She did ask if I wanted her to put the order in I said no.  Now I am ready to leave and a friend and I close out our tab.  I give her my credit card that took forever too. The bill was incorrect.....she switch our tab and put the incorrect amount on my card...so now she has to reverse it. REALLY? It took awhile to get out of here.  As some of our team members arrived at 5ish the place got really busy.  They would put in their orders but no drinks 10 mins later still waiting.  Finally they just had to go to the bar and get their beers.    It was a very disappointing experience.  I guess we will stick with the Mill Ave. area.  Too bad I'll never try the pretzel.
pos	Enterprise Pools keeps my pool looking PERFECT for swimming!  Not only do they preform top-notch weekly service sweeping clearing the baskets and making sure the chemicals are right but they are great at communicating.  One of the tough things about owning a pool and not being a pool expert is knowing what's going on.  They always take the time to explain what's happening in a way I can understand.  Broken pump or filter? No problem! They do repairs too.  They'll even fill you in on what you need to do as the seasons change or how to handle those pesky pool destroying monsoon storms!
neg	Terrible flight. Unaccompanied kids crawling on me spilling drinks throwing games. Contacted US Airways repeatedly wouldn't offer _any_ material compensation whatsoever for 4.5h of discomfort. Their official policy is that if you get from point A to point B they don't care what happens in between. Avoid awful.
pos	Two words for you. Mouth.  Orgasm  Wifey and I decided to eat here for our 5 year wedding anniversary. I have to say this is one of the best meals I've ever eaten hands down. We bought a Restaurant.com gift certificate that cost $10.00 for a $50.00 Gift Certificate. They also have half priced bottles of wine on Friday nights as well.  I went with the 5 course menu. I chose 2 of the dishes and let the chef pick the other three. We started out with the Crudo Cheese plate that was phenomenal! It had goat cheese goat feta goat mozarella (sooo good) cherry compote roasted dates tomatoes cured lamb jerky smoked olives and truffles with toast. If that doesn't give you a food stiffy your not human. The first dish I had which was one I picked was the butterfish crudo. It was served with oven roasted tomatoes and lardo with some sort of escebeche type sauce hands down my favorite plate in Phoenix right now. Holey cow! Next I had the albacore crudo with truffles apples black garlic and pepper. Another amazing dish. My next dish was one the chef selected as well it was their Japanese Fish Market Special. I don't recall the type of fish but it was good. I felt bad for this plate though it had to follow some illlll dishes. The 4th course I had was the mushroom gratin. It had hen of the woods crimini potato and was topped with an egg. I felt it was just too much a little clunky. That's probably just my taste though there was nothing wrong with the execution of the dish. I finished with the roasted veal served with parmesan creamy polenta. Friggin amazing I wanted to whisper sweet nothing into it's ear and smack it on the boohiney.    We went with a great bottle of Nebbiolo that was exceptional. The service was excellent. At first I was kind of weirded out with the restaurant being inside a retail shop but we moved to one of the high top tables and it felt more like a quaint little cafe. What a great meal fargin amazing!!  Pics to come
neg	First off they don't even deliver! Wtf!! Pizza is hands down the worst in surprise. Ate there once and that was enough for us. Service was horrible. Dominos is way better
pos	Best TexMex in the valley! The chips and salsa are home made and probably the best I have ever eaten. I had shrimp tacos which were delicious staff was very friendly and down to earth.....if you ate downtown give them a try.
neg	I have been to this location on several occasions thinking I would give this place the benefit of the doubt but boy was I wrong. The prices are great but the food is NOT.   All three times I have gone to this location the people that worked there had messy work outfits/uniforms and smelt like smoke. They also had dirty fingernails and were acting very unprofessional. The first time I went there the pizza tasted like dirt and another time it was still doughy. I love Little Caesars just not this location.
pos	Tried Roy's for the first time last night when we met some friends who rave about their Aloha Hour (Happy Hour).  Always avoided going because we tend to not like restaurant chains but this place is a gem and exceeded our expectations.  The bar area is relatively small but very classy.  We were able to have few drinks at the bar ($5 for beer wine and their signature cocktails) before we were able to get a table in the bar area for 5 people...thanks to Leah and the hostess staff (you guys are great).  Didn't have a bad drink -- loved the The Original Hawaiian martini was delish as was the mojito jalapeno margarita mai tai and wine.  A friend was sad the cucumber drink she liked was missing from the menu but sounds like the menu changes often so diners/drinkers get a chance to try new concoctions throughout the year.    For food we tried most of the HH specials.  Everything was spot on -- excellent flavors and beautifully presented.  The tuna roll and tempura shrimp rolls were my favorites (sushi rolls) with the lobster pot-stickers being a close second.  Some friends ordered dinner...and were able to speak with Chef Bray about his recommendations for fish.  She ended up getting the Crab Dynamite Baked Barramundi which was so yummy!  The happy rice on the side was great too.   My hubby got the Yellow Fin Ahi Poke -- something we have looked for since trying some fresh poke in Kona HI last year.  I couldn't believe the flavors...eating poke in the AZ desert!  Its preparation with the Wasabi Crème Fraîche made it a meal we will seek out again in the near future.  Ended our meal by sharing the chocolate souffle which was a perfect ending to a great Friday night gathering.    Definitely recommend Roy's for seafood that is excellently prepared.  Aloha Hour is a must.  Extra props to Matt our waiter and Leah on the hostess team for their accommodations and service.  We had a great night.
neg	Horrible service!  My friends and I (party of 6) arrived at 7:00 and were told it would be a 30 to 35 minute wait.  At 7:50 we were finally seated.    Next my friends ordered sushi and I ordered a chicken salad. Big mistake.  All of the sushi came out at different times and finally at 8:25 I asked where my salad was. 8:35 the server comes back and says they accidentally cooked it with dark meat and asked if I still wanted it with white meat to which I replied yes I wanted it with white meat. (My friends were done eating at that point.) He then unapologetically stated that will be another 10-15 minutes.    8:50 he brings out the salad and I ask for a fork. 8:55 he comes back with cheater chopsticks and tells me they are all out of forks.  I mean REALLY?!?  Long story short my friend stood up for me and told them to comp my salad which they did but the manager never came out to apologize.    And no I did not eat my salad with chopsticks; I took it home to eat instead.  Good food.  It's a shame they have such lousy service.
pos	Troy the owner is a brilliant businessman! Being a pharmacist myself I am familiar with the quality of his products and his facility. Trust me when I say his sterile compounding areas are more advanced than many hospitals in the Valley.  After spending a day at his old facility when I was still training I felt comfortable enough to send my mother to Troy so that he could help her with hormone replacement therapy. The docs around town trust him enough to let him dictate what a patient needs; they simply sign off on his recommendations. My mom has had a huge increase in her quality of life since seeing Troy and I feel the compounded HRT is safer than the Prempro she used to take.  Do not hesitate to consult a compounding pharmacist if you're having health issues that aren't being adequately addressed. Troy is one of the best in the Valley. It's worth the drive to consult with him and further prescriptions can be mailed to your home.
neg	If you can avoid going to this hospital I would STRONGLY recommend doing so. Your wait time in the ER will be at least 2 hours and then another hour waiting for someone to come see you. If they start you on antibiotics you can expect another 60 minute wait for your medicine. We had a recent incident that I can't go in to for privacy reasons but all I can say is potential lawsuit. Every time I have come to this hospital there is a hassle staff always takes the path of least resistance and are sometimes just downright unhelpful.   I have also heard horror stories from other people about Del Webb. I'm normally not a complainer and usually have great experiences wherever I go but it has been one thing after another with this place. If you can drive another few miles to Arrowhead Estrella or Thunderbird. Even though they are all Banners Del Webb must not invest in their staff or just don't care but whatever the case is compassion and care is not anywhere on their list of priorities.
pos	I love this restaurant concept. It makes for a fun dinner between friends and family. I wish there were ones like it in Central Phoenix so I don't have to drive a half hour for good food and a good dining experience.  The veggie options offered are plentiful and fresh which is important to me. The broth is so flavorful. But be warned weak tongued restaurant-goers the spicy broth has a kick that will stick!  Some are saying it's too expensive? I think it's worth it.
neg	Zen Buffet in Glendale Arizona:  Run away.  Fast.    Am usually the kind of guy that can find the silver lining in almost any situation i.e; \"our server was a most *excellent* mouth-breather...\" - but as I write this review I still remain unable to find any redeeming quality whatsoever.  It should be known:  #1:  I'm a guy; #2:  I'm single parent w/ kids; #3:  I can be Stalin-esque when it comes to buffets i.e; \"quantity has a quality all its own' - which should be a godsend to ownership when rating a buffet.  My expectations are low to start.  As such I am also very forgiving regarding buffets.  Food doesn't have to be awesome for a passing grade from my boys and I - it just can't suck.  Same thing with service:  If we're missing a place setting or salt - I'm the kind of guy who will just snag one off a neighboring table - and still tip.  Place has to reeeally go below and beside the call of duty to rate a negative (and yet I'll still tip...but that's how I roll  :-)  Zen Buffet - how much do I love thee?  I'd planned on making  list thanks to the generous 15\% off Zen was offering if you mentioned \"Yelp\" - but alas we've yet to find a thing.  What we *did* notice however is as follows:  1.  My boys and I have renamed the restaurant \"The Dancing Queen\" as this was the *only* song that played repeatedly for the 1st 44 minutes we were there.  We were having fun watching and listening to the folks around us as they would come to the same sudden realization :-p  2.  Much of the food was empty i.e; crab legs (Hey: at $12 for dinner I'd like to have the crab legs as advertised!).  I asked the attendant  refilling the food *twice* if she would pleease refill it.  It took asking the gentleman who was seating up front to get anything crab legs - and then the other patrons were busy waiting in the wings gobbled them all up in about 90 seconds.  Never refilled again either.   Oh HEY:  I actually *can* say something good about this place:  They refill the rice and noodles quite well!  But now back to it:  3.  One of my favorite dishes - salt & pepper shrimp - was misidentified and not available despite signage indicating otherwise.  The salt & pepper frogs legs were as advertised - just ultra weak in the spice and ultra old.  The shrimp in the bin that had the 'salt & pepper shrimp' sign was red.  And breaded.  And cold.  Health department?!?  4.  The lo mein noodles were bland and devoid of any flavour whatsoever as were the rice noodles.  And the creepy looking fried rice (bright yellow) was so hard bland and cold that we spat it out.  1st time.  Ever.    5.  The wonton soup had not wontons (picked out);  no baked scallops in the 'baked scallop\" (it was chopped 'krab' that was baked in a scallop shell).  It took us that long (and $40 bucks) to realize it was time to leave.  I decided to take one quick walk back around the sushi spot.  Like before most of it was out.  The sashimi on the far left side of the line looked like it had been cut and set out the day before yesterday.  Quite unappealing and I was actually afraid to touch it.    Felt I owed yelp a review due to the 15\% and I really feel bad for the ownership who will in all likelihood be out of business soon.  And the summer hasn't even started.    Looking forward to my first *real* review when I can report on a place that I actually want to go to (vs. hungry boys who spotted this place again as we were driving by today).    Off the cuff review here forgive the spelling/tense/general spaciness.  We're still hungry - but for something edible :-o
pos	Don't let the slightly sketchy neighborhood put you off.  Baiz market has some of the best food in town.  The small deli (cafe?  Not sure what to call it) located in the market has all of the staples such as shwarma and falafel.  the prices are cheap The service is snappy and friendly and the food is exceptional especially considering the price.  Wash down your meal with any one of many exotic drinks (or just choose a diet coke) in the beverage cooler.  Even if you've stuffed yourself silly wander on back to the bakery.  The assortment of traditional Middle Eastern sweets can't be matched anywhere in town.  Come early and wander around in the market to pick up your selection of hard to find ingredients.
neg	This place is definately a dive! Its small run down dated and unclean. Ive been twice now and both times were not by choice. Both times my water glass had nasty stuff on the outside and inside. Very disgusting. Their tacos are puny expensive and flavorless. Their guacamole just tasted weird almost like there was too much lime juice in it. Oh and those pictures that are posted on here are not accurate examples of what you get from LuLu's. Everything is tiny and doesnt have much color. This place does not impress me whatsoever and I about cry each time someone suggest that we go   :(
pos	The service has always been really good.  I love LOTS of things on the menu. The dixie pan fried chicken is great.  There's a great little sticky bun that comes with it.  The Del mar salad is great.  I've had great experiences going to chelsea's kitchen.    Overall it's in my heavy rotation on places I always say YES let's go there!
neg	My third time here and all kept getting more disappointing than the previous. The pizza has a rock-hard crust. First visit I had the roasted mushroom pizza. I really don't want al dente fungus on a pizza. Second visit I had the Mac n Cheese. You have to step your game up for Mac n Cheese in this neighborhood. I guess if you like really salty Mac n Cheese this is your place. Third visit the egg pizza. Seriously after being open for a couple months have your oven dialed in so not to dislocate your jaw trying to eat the crust. Total disappointment for a needed neighborhood pizza joint. They do have good beer prices for happy hour. That's a positive.
pos	A very reliable local garage. Bill is all about great customer service and goes the extra mile. He deflated my fears about \"being taken\" by other mechanics playing on my automotive ignorance. He's a truly good guy knows his stuff and will work to save me money if he can find it. I trust Bill and 25th Street Automotive. Thanks and we'll continue to bring our wheels into your shop.
neg	So mother always said if you can't say something nice don't say anything at all. When I finally reached someone at Ladlow's after two unanswered voice messages and an email about a bench ordered in September they were quick to refund my deposit after we determined the bench wasn't on order. They blamed it on the manufacturer and slow demand for the piece but the manufacturer said in an email to me they were surprised at that response and couldn't find an order from Ladlow's for the item. I was glad they sent the refund check so quickly. That's as nice as I can be.
pos	Of all the Chipotle's I really like this one.  The staff is exceptionally friendly and I don't think I've ever been in the place and I've\"ve been a lot where they weren't meticulously cleaning the restaurant with soapy suds.
neg	Do not trust this dealer. Originally I agreed to a $500 deposit on the vehicle I was interested in. When I found out that the dealer was building-in a bunch of extra costs in to the MSRP I found a better deal. When I told Johnny Medrano that our deal was off he tied-up $1000 in my account. Zero class zero professionalism not to be trusted.
pos	Dig it! Good beers on tap. Tasty food. Friendly servers. Cool place to hang out and relax. My fav pasty is the cajun chicken with the spicy sauce. Don't forget to check out the desserts. Towards the back is an iPad where you can pick a few tunes to be played..kinda neat if you're in the mood for something in particular. If you haven't checked it out you should. I like this location better than the Tempe location because it has more seating and a better scene for visiting with friends.
neg	This place is the worst for loans. It took four times for them to get my auto loan correct. Of course its always someone elses fault too I never really got a straight answer as to why I had to come back 4 times to close the loan... Its enough for me to switch banks & I've banked w/ them for ten years.
pos	How can anyone not give these guys a 5 star?  Cafe Rio invented the sweet pork burrito and nobody...and I mean NOBODY can do it better.  I moved here a year ago from Utah where Cafe Rios are as abundant as Micky Dees .... and I was so happy to see the Cafe Rio sign.    I eat there to much.  Its a 30 min drive to get there from where I live but I love that I don't ever have to wait in line as long as I did when eating at the Utah ones...  Let me help you with what to order:  No serious if you are reading this...go there TODAY and order this -   Sweet pork burrito with black beans hot sauce enchilada style with pico and guac ... no lettuce (unless you like lettuce ... I don't)
neg	The last time we went to this Claim Jumper we were interrupted during an intimate conversation by the server who went into an annoying and lengthy sales pitch about CJ gift cards. Who wants to have to sit through that while trying to have a nice quiet meal?  We overlooked that today and went back and guess what? The server balked when I ordered fish tacos and asked for the seasoned fries as one of the choices for side. She told us that even though the tacos are listed on the menu under the Sandwiches category which lists several choices of side dishes that automatically come with the order the fish tacos aren't included in that option. What? There is NO disclaimer on the menu that says \"...except for the fish tacos.\" Then when I insisted (because the menu specifically SAYS side dishes come with the items on the list DUH!) she pointed out that rice pilaf comes with the tacos so would I like to omit the pilaf in favor of the fries? What is she the Carbohydrate Police? No I would not like to substitute fries for the pilaf. I want both of them just like the menu indicates. I like both rice and fries thankyouverymuch. Then she said she'd send the manager over to talk to me. Fine send him. He arrived squatted down next to our booth and proceeded to examine the menu for errors. Nope. The menu is clearly misleading and I was clearly entitled to the fries with my tacos if I so desired. He left and twenty minutes later our meal was served. Strike number three the corn tortillas on the fish tacos were so tough that my husband could only eat one of his tacos and I had to discard the tortillas and eat the fish filling with a fork. We brought home leftovers for the dog and cats meanwhile vowing to NEVER EVER go back to Claim Jumper again.   Why go to Claim Jumper anyway when you can just go to the freezer section of your local supermarket and buy CJ products and save both money and aggravation?
pos	Mill Ave has been missing a good breakfast nook and it has made me very sad. Until now! The atmosphere is very modern. The color scheme is gray orange and black and boy do they stick to it down to the orange frosted cupcakes. Impressive. I had the best french toast I have ever had in my life right here at NCounter. I have only eaten here once and usually I don't give five stars out after the first visit but this place is THAT good. So happy to have such a fabulous breakfast restaurant so close to home.
neg	OMG you must be kidding and this place is in business?? so i have heard of Big Matts and wanted to try it. This afternoon i went their for the first time and what a JOKE. first of all i arrived at 12:15 PM and the front door was locked. I asked couple of men that were standing outside how to you get in this place and they told me from the front door which i was standing in front of. So i knocked on the door and the server opened the door. My first thought is to the owner dont be cheap and just go ahead and get a real lock for the front door. Then I asked servers where the bathroom was? she told me they dont have one however they share one with the hotel next door. (this is not a Hilton by the way). I asked i just want to wash my hands. She told me they had hand sanitizer up front. so i used it . I understand the place is small however there is health requirement and I am not sure how they pass this. I believe the employees would wash their hands more then once a day. CAUTION!!!! HEALTH.   Food. the server was nice and took my order. I asked for their best item on the menu and she highly recommended the daily special. Okay that is what i will get. I got two scrambled eggs fresh motezzerla sausage (disgusting) and sweet peppers this was served with home potato's and toast. how bad can the eggs be the sausage was uneatable the potato's were full of Rosemary and ONE slice of toast for $ 8.95. I have been to numerous breakfast restaurant  and never remember being served ONE slice of toast. Please dont be cheap for $ 8.95 you can serve two slice of toast.  I am not sure what the hype is about this place i will never go there. if you want breakfast go somewhere else like \"the breakfast club\".
pos	Great Job!
neg	I don't understand why peeps like this.  I just think it's sooooooo weird.  i like the concept and i like that they give you tastings.  but overall the food is meh AND it's kinda cold and lacks atmosphere.  but i guess it would be a haven for vegetarians and people who like soy.
pos	Wait a second...I have not written a review!  This is nuts!!!!!  Anyways...I adore this place.  LGO and the pizzeria are my favorite places in the world...lol...I am here at least 4-6 times per week.  It is nuts!  Anyways..the reason I am here all the time is because it is FABULOUS!!!!  This place can never go wrong!  The orange and fennel salad it amazing!  It is the perfect mix and each bite and a delight in your mouth and to your taste buds!  I often get this salad through out the week.  I love the kale and quinoa salad too!  It is my go to salad.  I am obsessed with the avocado pizza with prosciutto and goat cheese and the roasted corn pizza with prosciutto.  I wish I could get enough but I cannot!  The ambiance is awesome! Mr.Lynn is a genius and made this place so welcoming and open.  I love how its so laid back and romantic at the same time.  The parking is difficult but you expect that since it is so popular!  Now the Peanut Butter Pie!!!  OMG OMG OMG!!  There are no words...it is DELICIOUS!!  I try to refuse every time but I cannot.  I really enjoy the sangria.  The wine selection is great!  I just love this place!!!!
neg	This manager is a chauvinist pig he has fired me because he has gotten a complaint on himself he has made sexual comments to almost everyone that works there and is a very rude person. I would not take any one that I care about to this restaurant!!!
pos	The place to go during spring training after a game and see a baseball player (will be crowded for sure). the experience is just really neat though the place is covered head to toe with sports memorabilia definitely the place to go if you're a visiting sports fan in scottsdale
neg	I brought my sister and her friend who were in town for pedicures and eyebrow waxes. Also for my niece and her friend to get their nails for the Justin bieber concert. Well I feel horrible for taking them here.    Lynn has been doing my eyebrows for a while now. Even when she was at a different location. She HURT my sister and her friend. Almost 24 hours later and they are still in pain. She was extremely rude and very unprofessional. She had just finished eating and was smacking whatever food was left in her mouth the entire time. You could also hear her food digesting inner stomach which made the experience even more uncomfortable.   Now to the little girls.   Unfortunately we don't all speak the same language but that is no excuse to be blatantly rude and making fun of two little girls who are excited about a concert. The women painting their nails were CLEARLY making fun of them and the girls felt soooooo uncomfortable.    I will NEVER be back nor will I refer anyone.   There are plenty of nail salons and this one has lost my business and that of everyone I know.
pos	Came here on a Friday night after a bike ride. As an Irish bar there is a lot of whiskey on the wall but they can make whatever you need. The food was a hell of a lot better than I thought it was going to be.  On the encouragement of the bouncer I ordered the wings which were meaty but I've had better. What I should have gotten was the shepards pie. 2 of my friends got it and it was VERY good. I'm going to go back just get it on my own.  Lastly this place dishes out cheap strong drinks. Good place to get sauced before hitting a club.
neg	Why would anyone pay money for food like this?
pos	We attended this event today and loved it! The grounds are beautiful and spread out so it didn't seem like it was overly crowded.   This is a well thought out event with food trucks located throughout so if you get hungry there will be food near by.  The admission price was $7 and we felt it was a bargain.   There are a variety of artists so there is something for everyone to look at and/or buy.
neg	Worst massage EVER! They were 5 minutes late and had me leave 5 minutes early(Sounds like less than an hour). Then I asked for a deep tissue massage and they gave me a little dainty chick that couldn't squash a grape in a fruit fight! And then when it's all done you get to head back to the lobby and get the biggest sales pitch of your life. NEWS FLASH... You can get $40 massage's all day on groupon. There are better places you just have to look.
pos	I should have done this so long ago but we forget our Doctor's need reviews too! I've sent my boyfriend my family and my friend's to her. You should know about her too! I've been going to Dr. Bradley for 10 years! She is my all time favorite doctor because she is always bright smiling genuine and just overall warm! You want to thank her and hug her at the same time. Her staff is professional and friendly. Mandy at the front desk is wonderful at her job. I've followed Dr. Bradley to 2 locations and would never think of going anywhere else. She's helped me with everything from migraines to pnuemonia to well woman check ups to getting my gall bladder removed! What a versatile and knowledgeable woman she is! I take my son to her now and he isn't afraid to go in. Peace of mind knowing we will be treated well and taken care of is all I could really ask for in a general doctor!
neg	http://bedbugregistry.com/hotel/AZ/Fort-Mcdowell/Radisson\%25252DFort-McDowell/  I stayed July 14 2012 and received 20 bites on my arms and face that were instantly infected and the knuckle on my right hand was bit so much in one place that my finger swelled up extremely much and turned purple. The bites on my arms were more like large blisters that burned not itch. The burning was unbearable and very painful for days. I went to a couple pharmacy's to ask what kind of bites and they were all shocked at how instantly infected and serious they were one pharmacist advised me to seek a doctor immediately stating I could suffer permanent hand damage since being bit so much on the joint knuckle. Luckily the urgent care i went to in Scottsdale the doctor had seen a lot of bed bug bites and stated that is what they were. And yes they were all infected. I was shocked at how serious the bites appeared so quickly infected. He prescribed me 2 prescriptions very strong saying that if I didnt see improvement in 24 hrs to go immediately to a dermatologist to get stronger treatment.  I didnt see improvement until about 4 days later. The doctor also advised me to stay aware of my breathing in case I went into amphylactic shock.  I was horrified. The Mgr Bert Parra wrote me a letter stating they would not pay 120.00 for my doctor bills. Unbelievable. I contacted all of the television stations by website application since bed bugs are such a hot topic now in Az and I also filed a lawsuit in Fort McDowell Tribal Court. I would advise being very careful about staying in this hotel as they will obviously not take responsibility or help you. If you also stayed here and got bites feel free to contact me. Its been 2 weeks the bites did get about 50 percent better but it is a very painful and horrifying experience and the bites are not gone yet. I have scars from them as well on the few that have miminized. Im hoping they go away but It will be another few weeks before they are gone completely. Clicking on the above site you will see other similiar reports at this hotel. Please add yours if you experienced bites there it is not right that they do nothing to protect or assist the guests. I did contact the Radisson corp office who knew about the bed bug problem and I called Carla who stated \"she would look into a resolution for me\" but I called her back 3 times to which Carla advised me she had been busy in mtgs went on vacation and she never has returned my call with any resolution...I am shocked to see Carla had time to respond here though....well Carla its been 2 months and Im still waiting for my resolution and I posted a photo of the worst bite where i almost suffered permanent damage and loss of my hand movement....People! Do not take bed bug bites lightly they are extremely dangerous. Seek immediate medical assistance.
pos	Just had my first hot dog at Short Leash Dogs and quite honestly I can't call it a \"hot dog\" because that just conjures up images of well... a hot dog. And Short Leash Dogs are so much more and better than \"a hot dog\" the way most people know hot dogs. Know what I mean? No? Well go have a Short Leash Dog.   Really unique combinations various dog options (all local meats and produce) - bratwurst beer hot veggie...   My friend and I shared an Aiko (we chose the brat as our dog) with mango chutney red onions cilantro mayo and jalapeño on a naan (you might have read that in other reviews no traditional buns here!).   You can find the Short Leash Dogs truck at the Phoenix Public Market on Wednesday evenings and Saturday mornings and if you follow them on Twitter (@shortleashdogs) you can find out when/where else they make regular stops... scottsdale central phoenix... Track 'em down and eat their food. And talk to them - Brad and Kat are smart enthusiastic folks with a great sense of humor and offer superb food and service! What's not to love?
neg	Came up to Hooters to catch the UFC fight.  There was a 45 minute wait for a table due to the fight night.  Luckily my buddy found a group on a large bench on the patio that was only using half of it and was cool with us sitting on the other side.  Typical UFC fight crowd.  Youger guys in their 20s with lots of black attire with white lettering.  I couldn't believe there was a family in the middle of the patio.  Early 20 year old couple and about 4 kids ranging from 1-6 years old.  Right smack in the middle of people getting drunk and smoking on the patio at Hooters...no lie.  Absolutely rediculous.  We had probably one of the dumbest waitress of all time.  My boy ordered a Michelob Ultra (weak and embarassing as that is) and she was trying to spell and sound it out at the same time then looks up and asks \"what is that...a...beer?\"  True story.    I ordered 20 wings with blue cheese and ranch half a dozen oysters and my other buddy ordered a chicken quesadilla.  45 minutes to an hour later she brings out the wings with no dressing.  Had to flag her down to bring the dressing.  Still no quesadilla still no drink refills.  Finally the quesadilla comes after all the wings are long gone.  I understand its a busy fight night but its still hooters.  Quesadillas and wings should be practically on standby.    The waitress would disappear for so long we just couldnt take it anymore and left before the fights were even getting to the good cards.  Service absolutely sucked wings were below mediocre and I dropped 50 bucks on wings oysters and 2 beers.  No thanks.  Hope I never come back here and definitely not on a fight night.
pos	Southwest blows its competitors so far out of the water I actually feel bad for the other airlines.   1. Of the countless times I've flown with them my flight has been delayed only twice and both times less than one hour. 2. NO BAG FEES.   3. Nine times out of ten the lowest price. 4. Killer customer service laced with sarcasm veiled cynicism and high efficiency.  I love it. 5. They never give me an inquisitive look when I order a cocktail on the super early morning flights.  Thank you for not judging me SW Flight Attendants.
neg	You've got to hand it to Candace Nelson; she knows how to bake up palpable buzz.  You need look no further than the perpetual line at Sprinkles Cupcakes in Scottsdale.  If only the cupcakes were as good as the hype.  Unfortunately they are not.  It comes down to style over substance.  Sprinkles Cupcakes has a great look from the windows frosted with the outlines of cupcake wrappers to the spare wood display racks.  The aesthetic is clean modern and restrained.   The cupcakes are impeccable in terms of their appearance.  The bakery even offers an interlocking cardboard stand with optional ribbon trim to create a display for a special event.  The graphics and design are top-notch.    While we may eat with our eyes first the disappointment creeps in once you move beyond the visual and taste the cupcakes.  At best they're okay.  In order to give Sprinkles a fair shake I pre-ordered a dozen online.  Anyone can order a minimum of a dozen cupcakes online with 24 hours advance notice.  The real advantage of the pre-order is that you get to skip the mayhem of the line.  It's worth it to walk right up to the counter and pick up your prepaid order without having to stand in the chaotic line and watch the crowd's tension level rise as they run out of flavor after flavor.    As a home baker who makes everything from scratch I found Sprinkles Cupcakes to be resoundingly underwhelming.  Their signature Red Velvet Cake was a real disappointment.  The cake itself was bitter and sour at the same time.  It also had an unpleasant lingering aftertaste.  Actually all of the cupcakes I tried with chocolate cake had the same bitter and sour taste combined with the lingering unpleasant aftertaste.  It was almost like the chocolate cakes weren't mixed properly before they were baked.  If it has been one or two cupcakes I would have given them the benefit of the doubt; however this place takes the concept of bittersweet chocolate to a new and very strange level.  The Carrot cupcake is also misnamed; it should be called a Spice cupcake instead because the presence of any carrot is nearly undetectable.  In fairness the Coconut cupcake was the best of the 12 sampled.  The taste of both the cake and the icing was great; the cake itself was a bit stiff and dry (but less than the others sampled).    In terms of texture the 12 cupcakes sampled varied from \"sturdy\" (e.g. nothing close to tender) to dry and crumbling apart.  This is definitely not what I expect from a premium bakery.  Some other reviewers have commented that the cupcakes are too expensive.  Clearly they haven't been to a grocery store lately to check on the price of butter eggs sugar cream cream cheese etc.  The cupcakes are fairly priced for the premium ingredients that Sprinkles uses.  However those ingredients are not falling into the most adept hands.  Perhaps this is an issue with a newly trained staff.    For the money and the pleasure of the experience enjoy an Ooey Gooey from Tammie Coe instead of Sprinkles.  Tammie's cupcakes are the real deal and are everything that Sprinkles aspires to be.  Just be sure to allow Tammie's cupcakes to return to room temperature before you devour them.  They're sublime while the cupcakes at Sprinkles are serviceable at best.  Sprinkles Cupcakes was worth trying once to see what all the hype was about.  However I won't be back.
pos	i hate going to places that i can goto near home in Phx for the Cubs games.. but my daughter wanted pizza and we saw Z and had to go becuz we know how good it is. I like this one alot better then ours.
neg	I have the same problem as customer above. Working with I forgot her name who is giving us a run around and I called her and told her I wasn't happy about our service and I have read bad reviews and I will be writing one too and she became rude. I would not buy from this place.
pos	BACON people!  Spicy Italian sausages brats even heirloom veggies by the pound?  Locally raised hogs and none of the extra chemicals the corporations and grocery stores use?  I have found my personal piggy promised land and it is The Meat Shop.    I headed over here with some buddies after hearing that some local restaurants and patrons have been taking notice of the flavor and quality they offer.  We were quite pleased.  The staff were helpful and knowledgeable about the meats cuts and preparation.  We grilled up everything that night - the sausages the brats the veggies... even the bacon... because why not?  I think we spent a grand total of $20 and we still had enough leftovers to throw in with some sunny side up eggs and toast the next morning for breakfast.  This place is fantastic and surprisingly the same cost as most of the stuff you'll find in the grocery store.  I can't wait to head back over for round 2!
neg	As you can see I am catching up on my yelping tonight...  All i can say about cadillac ranch in tempe is that I had the worst experience here ever. The service was horrible and so was the manager.   My friends and I went there around 8:15 p.m. We just wanted to get a few appetizers and a few drinks.  We had this young brunette waitress. We asked her what time they stopped serving food. (I don't like to order right before to closing). She said she thinks they stopped serving at 9:30 p.m. but the bar at 1 a.m. We asked for waters to start while look over the menu. 15 minutes later we get our waters. We tell her we're ready to order so the 5 for us order a beer each. She tells us she'll be back in a min to get our food order.  30 min pass and we still don't get our drinks. We try to flag our server down and she just  tells us to wait a second. We finally get our  drinks at 9:15.  (we were being as patient as possible because we've all worked in the service industry before.) We tell her we are ready to order food now. She tells us that they stopped serving food already!!! By that time I was pretty pissed. I ask to talk to the manager and she asks WHY? haha.. So by then I didn't even want to deal with a  little girl who absolutely had no clue what she was doing.   The manager approached the table. I told him exactly what had happened.  He advises us that they serve food until 1030 p.m.  He apologizes about his server and says it wasn't her fault because she was busy and she is new.  By this time it was already passed 10 p.m.   She brings the check by and says to us \"by the way it only took me 10 minutes to get my drinks not 45min. But I'm sorry.\" WOW... decide for yourselves everyone!  Hopefully that waitress found a new career and that manager(heavy set man with curly red hair) found another career as well. How hard is it to get decent service these days?
pos	Love this place!  Their slices are delicious (and HUGE) and a great deal.  Service is always fast and good.  Their loyalty programs (frequent visits and VIP card) are also great.   The fact that they're locally owned and support the local community doesn't hurt either.  :)  It's basically the only place I go to for pizza nowadays.  1 slice is more than enough and I love that I can get it just the way that I want.  If you're a member of their VIP program (free to join) you can also get the slices for dinner too.
neg	I can't agree with the other ladies who have posted their experiences.  It's been awhile but the last time I did business with these guys I knew I would never go back.  I took my car in to have the wheels balanced after I had purchased a set of brand new wheels and tires from the internet.  When I mounted the new wheels I was getting a vibration at freeway speeds so I decided to take it to Tire Pros to have the wheels balanced.  They charged me a resonable price since I did not purchase the wheels from them.  When I got home I did a quick walk around the car and that's when I noticed one of my wheels had a piece of metal chipped off right at one of the holes for the lug nuts. I know it wasn't there before because they were brand new.  I called Tire Pros back and told them what I found.  They said to bring it back which I did.  When I got there the manager said he asked the tech about it and he said the damage was already there!  The manager then said there was nothing they could do about it.  =/  Nothing I dislike more than a dishonest business.  If they admitted to it I would probably be able to forgive and forget but I just want others to know that they aren't the \"Pros\" their name claims to be.
pos	I love the Tempe Library. The Culture Pass is a great program the audiobook selection is good and the seemingly unlimited resources are wonderful.
neg	BEWARE THIS PLACE WILL RIP YOU OFF!!!  MAKE SURE YOU CHECK THE TOTAL OF YOUR ORDER WITH THEIR MENU PRICES!  My wife and co workers ordered food last night.  They asked to pay separate for their orders.  The restaurant said it wasn't a problem.  They noticed after the fact that all 7 people were charged a $3 delivery fee.  THAT'S $21 ON TOP OF THEIR TIP THEY ALREADY GAVE THE DRIVER!!!  No one bothered to tell them they were getting hit up 7 times for a delivery fee including the driver.  They also asked if there were any specials or coupons going on at the moment.  The person on the phone said no.  They received a menu with their order and sure enough there were coupons.    On to the food my wife's portion to the feast was salad.  For $14 she received 2 salads that fit in two small containers.  She said that a 99 cent salad at Wendy's had more going on than her $14 salads.    That's the last time anyone in this family orders from Rosatti's.     The bottom line is this area is CRAWLING with amazing Italian food.  IMHO there is no room for ripping off your customers there are so many other options in this area to choose from.  Judging by the low reviews and lack of effort this company is making to make things right I can't see them being in business much longer.
pos	Really good food fun atmosphere great experience and totally unique and fun.  I would way rather spend my money at a one of a kind family owned shop than a cheaper- dime a dozen corporate mcdonalds.
neg	This place was a NIGHTMARE!   I say this when comparing the Tempe Campus to the West and Downtown campus and the ASU Policies in general.   I was misadvised by my program advisor two times - on major issues pertaining to acquiring my degree. Then my program changed advisors on me three times in two years. Then when I was finally accepted into my program the school decided to rewrite the curriculum! That gave me another headache and a half.   I hated the parking situation... It is not fun walking 2432087 miles to class and then to the opposite side of the campus in 130 degree heat; and I hate President Crow for all the misery he has caused the people of the university.   To add insult to injury when it came time for me to graduate I applied for graduation on time and my name wasn't even in the commencement book!! What was supposed to be the happiest moment of my young-adult life had me in TEARS!!!!
pos	I am in love.  This restaurant does everything a good restaurant should.  Ambiance service and product were good.  The only disappointment I had was with the hour wait on the Monday we went without a reservation.  My party of four had an excellent time celebrating a birthday.  Two had the short ribs.  Tender to a fault served with delicious Bar-B-Que sauce and pecan grits.  One had the fillet with a spicy aioli and delicious potatoes. My meal was a huge pork chop stuffed with Maytag bleu on a ancho bread pudding.    For an app I split the chop salad.  It deserves special mention and I do recommend it but it is not a sustaining salad more of a amuse-bouche.  For dessert we split the peanut-butter cheese cake delicious.  The beverages deserve some mention.  The wine list is this restaurants' only fault it is tooooo long.  There is a smaller delicious by-the-glass selection.  The beer selection is well crafted.  I had two of my favorite beers Dogfishhead Chicory Stout something I had only had by bottle wonderful.  I normally don't like high-priced eateries b/c there is often a lack of creativity Cowboy Ciao doesn't disappoint.  Recommended over any Capital Griller or Flemmingsery for creativity and value for dollar.
neg	My wife and I found a living room and dining set for our new house that we love. The salesman was extremely helpful and offered us all of these great deals.  It is now two months later and we still don't have the complete purchase.  The dining room table top has been sent back twice (the delivery men say this happens \"all the time\" due to damaged tops).  We were sent the wrong end tables.  The coffee table was damaged one delivery and smelled rancid the next.  That salesman we liked has a difficult time returning phone calls now too.  Fortunately customer service has done their part to accommodate this circus of sending us seconds.  So much for a great deal.    Seven months later and we finally have all of the pieces for our family room... Four stars for the  furniture we really like but felt the service was completely ridiculous... knocking the score down to one star.
pos	OK I went based on Tim C.'s Yelp review of this place and I am so glad I did. I rode my bike up there around 1PM Wednesday afternoon and I have to say I was not disappointed.   Even though it was hot out the outdoor table was surprisingly cool and comfortable. I got an iced soy latte and it was so good. I don't know how to explain it but there is great tasting espresso and there is bland espresso. This place just has great tasting espresso. I found out while I was there that Ted (the guy who made it) had roasted the beans himself. You can buy the beans from them if you are one of those industrious people who grind and brew your own espresso drinks...I am not. I prefer to leave that to the professionals.  He actually ground the espresso when I ordered my drink. If you get the chance please go see what I am talking about. You will notice how much better the espresso is.  The place itself is so beautiful and relaxing. If you sit outside like I did you are basically sitting in a big outdoor garden. It is kept cool by the overhead canopy and the swamp cooler air blowing out from inside the coffee shop. Ted was really friendly I felt comfortable just hanging out for a while reading my book. Unfortunately the coffee shop closes at 2 PM otherwise I bet it would be beautiful at night. This place definitely looks like something that would be in a cool little town somewhere and  not off of a busy street like Hayden Rd.   Ted also told me he makes the lemonade himself fresh squeezed something I love and will definitely try. When I go back I think I will go a bit earlier.  I may do a bit of plant shopping as well while I am there...  Bottom line: Great atmosphere drinks and service!
neg	We just recently moved out of these apartments and it was the best thing we ever did.  During our year of living in this lovely place we encountered tons of roaches mold and broken run down equipment. Not to mention the management. They were the biggest jerks we have ever had to deal with. They never fixed our things in a timely matter nor did they care too. Very rude and ugly people.
pos	These guys are great.  I had an old Craftsman mower probably 8yo that even sat unused in a basement for a couple years.  It coughed and wheezed barely even turning over.  I brought it to them and now it works (and even looks) brand new!
neg	So I hate to give Jalapenos a one star however after the last visit I will most likely not return (nor will I be sending any business there)...  My boyfriend and I went there about 2 weeks ago to celebrate our 1 year anniversary (kinda cheesy but we had our first date there). We showed up later in the evening about 8:30 pm and because of this we inquired about their hours. The last thing either of us wanted to do was walk into a restaurant 20 minutes before they were closing. The hostess informed us that we had an hour 9:30 pm closing and she seated us. One of the servers promptly brought us chips and salsa and water. Unfortunately that was all we were served for our meal. The 2 servers assisting the tables next to us refused to acknowledge our presence. Other employees began to take down tables even though it was 9 pm. After 20 minutes of waiting we finally left. I looked for someone to speak to however all of the employees seemed to have dissapeared from the floor (as well as the hostess). By the time we got back to my side of town it was too late to go to dinner. Happy anniversary?  Anyways because I really did like the restaurant I called on Monday and spoke to one of the managers regarding the issue. While she apologized (and confirmed they close at 9:30 pm) she did not extend an invite back and simply stated she would let the owner know. I never heard anything more which was very surprising... while I was not looking for a free meal a phone call would have been a nice follow-up from the owners. It only takes a couple of minutes...  Anyways we ended up celebrating our anniversary over lunch the next day at Blue Agave off of Scottsdale Rd and Mayo. Huge difference in service delicious food and drinks and reasonable prices. Considering that there isn't a huge difference in distance from Jalapenos you would think their service would be a little bit better...
pos	Super!
neg	Yes as someone stated before this place makes hooters look like a classy restaurant. You walk in and the nurse tells you to sit wherever you want at this enormous awkwardly shaped table (a cross). I'm sure the owner or whoever designed it thought it was brilliant but it was really awkward seating for our 6 person group. You sit on the outside of the cross and the \"nurses\" work on the inside taking orders/serving etc. The inner lining of the cross also has mirrors so you can check out your ugly nurses' asses from a variety of unflattering angles. And you end up staring and being stared at by other patrons of the restaurant since you have to sit facing them.  The food is really disappointing. Seriously you expect the food at HAG to be like a \"guilty pleasure\" but for being that unhealthy it has no flavor. Apparently all they really intend is to clog your arteries not to feed you something delicious. You can't justify putting that food in your mouth because it tastes like soggy mush. Each patty is a half pound of unseasoned beef cheese is optional. You have to go up and get your own tomatoes/onions/pickles (no lettuce) and also your own fries (which they charge extra for and only put out in small batches so you have to wait in line to get them since they run out so quickly). The fries yes you would expect them to be delicious for being fried in lard but no they are soggy and gross. It was basically eating some disgusting potato and ketchup casserole. Oh and all beverages come in a bottle including water which is another way for this cheap restaurant to charge you.   Our \"nurse\" (i.e. waitress) was also 40+ years old and should not have been wearing that skimpy outfit and the other nurse was too fat for her job. I guess they make the ugly nurses work during weekdays (jk..not really). The service was terrible too. Seriously there was barely anyone there and the nurses acted like they were busy doing something and never tended to us or followed up with us. Like dumbas$es we still paid tip.  Anyway go to hooters if you want better tasting food better service and better looking waitresses. I'm sure it's equally unhealthy so don't feel bad. If you want burgers however Red Robin has a tasty selection and their fries are absolutely delicious (and they bring them to you so you're not standing in line like an a$$). Come to think of it I think HAG stole their menu from In-N-Out. The burgers are the same just bigger and flavorless. At In N Out you can order a hamburger a cheeseburger a double-double and then the \"secret menu\" of increasing cheeseburger sizes and  which is exactly what HAG does.   Basically the way HAG runs its restaurant is to cut corners. Make you serve yourself while still bringing your food to you to collect tip. The huge table is easy to service cuz hey it's just one huge table. You're not really engaged in what is supposed to be an amazing and awesomely unhealthy experience to remember. Nothing is fun about being at HAG. They don't live up to the theme of the restaurant than say 5&Diner where you get the feel that you're in a 50s diner. Oh and the music sucks.  Bottom line go to this restaurant if you want to clog your arteries. That's all you'll get out of your experience. That and regret.
pos	Best value for your money   Clean comfy beds.  Quite.  Great breakfast that is included.
neg	My boyfriend and I try to eat very healthy and were in the area and hungry for dinner. We saw Zoe's  kitchen and thought we would give it a try... The only reason I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 is because the girl at the counter was pretty friendly. The food however was bland and terribly unimpressive. I had the Chicken Roll-ups and they were cold pre-made and lacking in any culinary skill what so ever.  When I ordered them I asked if i could get spinach instead of lettuce and she said they are pre-made every morning so I can't change anything... Also They claim to be a \"healthy alternative\" and they ONLY have white flour tortillas and do not offer wheat. In my fruit salad there were 2 ROTTED grapes and when my boyfriend showed them they said \"oh ok sorry\" then went back to whatever they were doing...  Honestly there are many better alternatives to go to and spend $7-$10 a plate... I do not recommend going there at all
pos	They don't serve food they serve sex on a plate. At first glance the place looks like a hallway but it's really a flavor factory hidden away between two buildings no one cares about because those places don't have Pasty's. The service is fast  friendly and the music is off the chain.  The food is not to be forgotten though there are so many selections of Pasty variations that anyone with any craving will loose all control of there facial expressions. I only wish the place was bigger there have been times when I've  had to wait for a space to open up but that's not necessarily a bad thing.  That time allowed me  to prepare myself for the nirvana inducing flavorgasm that is The Cornish Pasty Company.
neg	I love green. I've been eating there for a few years now and while it may not be the healthiest veg good it is delicious. I was very disappointed today when one of the girls (a blonde haired girl) at the front desk was incredibly rude  after I inquired about the kind of \"meat\" being used. She refused to talk to me about it saying it was secret. Shocked I stated that businesses really should disclose that type of info without hesitation and she said \"no they don't and aren't going to.\" I thought she was very hostile even though I was just curious. It's not like I was going to try and steal their recipes!  Staff should be friendly and understanding about questions its what makes customers trust and support their efforts.
pos	This is a great breakfast stop!  Gotta love the homemade biscuits... are you kidding me!  Awesome! CB is a huge chain but they do some great things.    The only thing is the way they have designed the space the servers are in the back a lot... too much.  They need to be on the floor more to make sure the cups stay filled up!
neg	Went with my 19 year old son for late breakfast today. Sadly the food is delicious. It's everything else that ruined it! The waitress never cracked a smile and just seemed annoyed to even have to wait on us. We are about the friendliest people you could wait on so I have to believe she either doesn't like her job or just has a general over-all bad attitude. My son and I both ordered waffles. There was no syrup on the table so I asked her to bring some maple syrup with order. After she walked away we noticed that we were the only table without a bottle of syrup so I grabbed a bottle from the table next to us. The waffles came hot and delicious. When we got the check my son picked it up to look at it and he noticed that there was a charge of $1.75 for each of our little individual syrups that came with the waffle (which neither of us ended up using as we used the large bottle we had grabbed from the other table). When I asked the waitress about the charge she told me that \"we had ordered syrup\". I  of course said I had just asked for syrup ( not ordered) their \"gourmet\" syrup that I didn't even know about! She said she would have the manager take it off. She ended up sending some other employee over who insisted I had ordered syrup which I guess translated into ordering their SPECIAL syrup. If you think this is sounding absurd we're on the same page! I am the least picky or cheap person you could ever meet! It was 100\% the principle! I even gave the lackluster waitress a 20\% tip just because that's the kind of person I am! In the end they took the charge off for one of the syrups because I had opened mine but son hadn't. Mr. or Ms. Manager.....shame on you! In this day and age the least we can expect when we have lots of dining options is to be treated as a valued customer! I'll be going back to Butterfields where there is good food and service with a smile!
pos	Kindred Spirits has closed their doors. It is a sad thing that we on the west side of Phoenix cannot support such a friendly and community oriented business AND one that gave you the option to drop by for a quick coffee or for a more complete dining experience. The live music on the weekends was also something a bit rare for our side of town and will be missed. Richard and Debra did a marvelous job updating the space and making it a warm and welcoming place. I am sorry that Youngtown has lost this business.
neg	No cheese means no cheese. Shame on me for thinking the employees at the Arrowhead location can read. I will never order from Jason's again.
pos	Wife and I had the large burgers. Many options as to toppings whole grain bun is also an option. Store is spotless and staff is young and cheerful. I had sw style w/guacamole and jalapeno spouse chose classic american cheeseburger. We ordered sweet potato fries to split. They are awesome and the single portion was large enough for 2 1/2 people. We were advised (in advance) that burgers would be pink inside which we prefer. If you want yours well done ask. You order at counter and the food is brought to your booth. This was our second visit and we would return. Store is nnear movies in food are of Tempe marketplace so expect to spend some time looking for a spot.
neg	4 STARS???  If I could I would be all up in giving 0 stars in this motherfucker.  I visited Ticoz based on the many good reviews. FAIL!  Is TICOZ short for TOSTITOS?  Because I swear... the chips served by the waiter were out of a cellophane bag from Costco.   Margarita.... more ice than anything. Bleh.  Service.... poor. We waited to be seated. We waited to have a drink order taken. Waited to get our drinks.   The main courses were bizarre to say the least.  The \"tamales\" were more like 2 scoops of sweet corn polenta.The shrimp were in a pile next to it rubbery frozen slightly off flavored. The rice and beans generic.  The burgers were more like sliders. I think the burgers are prepared far in advance and assembled prior to serving. The bun was made soggy by the watery salsa. The mayo... became watery from the salsa as well. The cole slaw was bleh. The waffle fries were decent.  The waiter was just weird. He was disengaged unfriendly and sluggish.  Yo what be up wit yo foolz an yo fo stah reviews?!@!  One of the worst places I have eaten in Phoenix - super trendy looking with miserable vittles.  1 star only because there is no way to give 0 stars.  Word is bond!
pos	This is the best restaurant in Phoenix. My wife and I have been eating out here for years Their servers are great and the food is always delicious. The entire menu is very good and the specials are always unique.  Check out their website at http://www.phoenixcitygrille.com
neg	Where do I begin?  Let's just say that my visit to Star Nails and Wax was beyond horrible.  Upon being seated for my pedicure I instantly overheard the cosmetologist make a snide comment about my feet.  Of course she wasn't remarking this in English but rather in Vietnamese which I understand.  I did not let on that I spoke the language in order to see what other choice things that she had to say to me.  Needless to say the rest of the visit continued on this negative note.  After soaking my feet the technician then tried to use a dirty towel to dry them off.  At this point I should have gotten up and walked away but I did not listen to my instincts.  I let them continue and am sorry that I did.  The completed product was not a pleasant sight.  In the store the color they chose was a very light pink however upon returning to my residence I noticed that the color was a very dark and unappealing shade.  I had to remove the color from my feet and repaint them myself.  Not only was the service poor but the end result was not worthy of the relatively high prices that they charge.  If you wish to come to an condescending and incompetent nail salon feel free to check out Star Nails and Wax but please leave any reasonable expectations at the door.
pos	I stopped in with a friend on a Saturday night after a friend had recommended it to me and was totally thrilled we did. We sat at a table for sushi and waited no longer than 10 minutes for a table - amazing for 8 pm on a Saturday in old towne.  Unfortunately they had sold out of the oysters but the other dishes we'd ordered were fabulous - starting with a seared tuna dish then softshell crab roll rainbow roll and the green mussels. The seared tuna was cooked and cut perfectly - just the right temperature with a peppery \"rub\" the rolls were a decent size with thick cuts of fish and plenty of flavorful crab and the mussels were a tad overcooked for my preference but the creamy texture and buttery flavor still made it a winner.   The thing I appreciated most was actually the service - we weren't rushed or hassled and the food came out a dish at a time giving us a chance to eat and enjoy before getting our next dish. At other sushi joints I am constantly feeling rushed while trying to fit all of the dishes on the table (and I'm not what you'd call a slow eater!). This was a happy medium for me. The server confirmed that we were ready for the bill instead of just dropping it off without asking - it's the little details that make a big difference to me.  My only other con was creepy old men leering at us from the bar...but that's what you get in Scottsdale.
neg	Visiting Postino Wine Cafe makes me feel like I am in another city... an urban metro pedestrian city such as San Francisco. Its casual yet sophisticated and quite enjoyable. I recently visited Postino with two friends and had the Bruschetta -- we selected the Fresh Mozzarella with Tomato and Basil the Smoked Salmon and the Roasted Peppers with Goat Cheese. Thumbs up on all of these yummy appetizers! The clientele is a hip diverse crowd reflective of its gentrified charming neighborhood of mid-century ranch homes and yet just a hop from the Biltmore and Arcadia neighborhoods. Ah... Phoenix is growing up! Wish I knew more about wines to tell you more about that. It appeared to be a nice selection and there were bottles you can buy to take home as well. Parking is a challenge however I will definitely be back. http://www.postinowinecafe.com/  Update: Postino's is one of many restaurants/bars in AZ that permits concealed weapons without permits and is noted on the Arizona State Rifle and Pistol Association in their CCW Cafe page: http://www.asrpa.com/ccwcafe.html For that reason I am reducing the previously 5-star rating to 1-star.
pos	My boyfriend and I went to Film Bar last night to see Iron Sky. Neither of us had been there before and the decision was made quickly so we had no idea what to expect. The bartender was incredibly nice friendly informative and genuine. The prices for the bar were very reasonable and I thought that $7 for tickets was MORE than reasonable. We were there more than an hour early and it was so nice to just sit back on the low booths and chat.  I gotta admit I totally fell in love with this little place and I can't wait to go back!  My ONLY concern is that by the time our movie was done there was a DJ playing music so loudly that you could hear it in the theater and you couldn't talk without shouting in the bar so we had to go outside to converse with our friends. I would bet that the place doesn't have a DJ all the time though.
neg	Drive-up ordering box broken for months today at lunch ordered a Double Del Cheeseburger but they had no meat to make burgers.  Need I say more! Off too Whataburger.
pos	As a frequent traveler into Scottsdale I was looking for something new and different to celebrate with a young up and coming professional baseball player---who happens to be my nephew. We were forewarned this place had no prices on their online menu and appeared to be owned by Mastro's which consistently has excellent food.   Michael Dominick opened Dominick's Lincoln Avenue Prime Steakhouse last fall after baseball season in the small but excellent Scottsdale Quarter. (I'll admit to frequenting this Nike store in travels to Phoenix.) The ambiance is that of an elegant steakhouse. The rooms are dark with huge crystal chandeliers. Very opulent without being ostentatious!.   We both ordered the bone-in filet which is an excellent aged prime cut. Supposedly according to our very professional server this cut is about 16 oz with a bone yielding about a 14 oz serving. My limit on steak is typical 6-8 ounces and I ate my entire meal making me think (1) This place really is THAT GOOD and (2) I doubt this is more than a 10 oz serving.   We started with a warm assortment of breads and in deference to my guest we minimized the veggie's ordered. (I'll go back during baseball season :-) )   After ordering a glass of of the extensive but reasonably priced wine list we looked at dinner entree. The steaks come with a choice of rubs and sauces. The house rub was described as \"cajun-style but not overwhelming\". My theory is sauces on steaks are useful for poor cuts of meat but take away from great cuts; hence I went no sauce.   The result was an incredibly great dinner of Bone-in filets ordered medium rare no sauce and a loaded mashed potato side. (This side comes pre-prepared or you can ask for ramikans of cheese chives bacon and sour cream and build as you like at the table. We finished with a scoop of ice cream and a cappuccino for desert.   Excellent steak spot and a welcome high-end addition to the Scottsdale food scene.  One comment: The \"Branding\" of the restaurant is confusing. Either call it \"Dominick's\" or \"Lincoln Avenue\" but not both. This actually caused confusion in trying to locate this spot and diminishes the feng shui and brand loyalty you'd want to keep and associate. (Qualifier: I'm not a branding expert and this is strictly my opinion.)   I would love to see Mastro's try a southwest cuisine spot!
neg	Dismal abject revolting.  These are words one would use to describe the contents of a garbage can or a snuff film. You know nice pleasant things that one would enjoy on a Sunday afternoon. Shogun however deserves none of this high praise. These words are a lofty goal by their standards.   I was so unfortunate to collide unwillingly with this place one Saturday for lunch and decided to order the unagi roll and the Panko Udon. I was expecting some common sense from the chef/wank they picked up off the street but even hope fails occasionally in an explosion of misery. The unagi roll was horrible. The rice was not fully cooked the contents were soggy and tasted old. The sushi would have been better if the chef had taken the ingredients put them down his pants sat on them for 5 minutes while riding a bull and then vomited on the resulting creation. Later the Panko Udon arrived and it was even worse. I understand that it was panko breaded and not a tempura batter but still it was absolutely horrendous. They could not have overcooked the vegetables shrimp and fish more.  It was greasy bland insipid cooking that could not have been made better even if it were served with a diamond ring.  The store bought cheap as you can find udon was undercooked and had the texture of noodles that had been sitting for about 30 minutes in a colander. These little beauties were served in a pool of horrific bottled tsuyu sauce that left a lingering chemical aftertaste that was just a delight to behold.  I would not eat here again even if my scrotum were stapled to a chair and I was chained to a table. I have to give this place one star too many because Yelp unfortunately has a one star minimum. I would even rate any fast food chain better than this place. I have had better airline food.  Cheers Until then get the beers in... Just not at Shogun.
pos	Great theatre! Super clean and nice sound in all theatres. Only caveat: I can read the prices on the beverage and popcorn menu sign thing so when I order a medium I want a medium I can see that for 50 cents more I can get the large. I just don't want to pee myself when I get caught up in a good flick. But thanks anyway.
neg	CS wow. Really hit them hard.  I don't really disagree cause I will never recommend this place or ever go back. There was a Dennis guy there who was a total turn off I hope he doesn't own the place but he did act like he did. Our Service was very old school like where they did not care about you. They also didn't look happy to be there. News Flash change your life.  We were hungry and that was the first place we saw so we dipped in. Big mistake it could of been the beginning of a horror movie.  Next time Native New Yorker or Buffalo Wild Wings.
pos	Aaron Has Been My Tattoo Artist for a long time and the quality of Aaron and all the artists in this shop are amazing very cleansterile and safe.   Be Back soon need some work done
neg	if you drink wine this is not the place to go . All four bottles I purchased were heated or in beer words Skunked I did notice tasty liquors were very cheapo will NEVER buy wine from this place
pos	I am a huge fan of this place. I haven't ventured outside of the teppen tables so my viewpoint may be limited. The atmosphere is quite loud and lively but definitely fun. It is great for a nice dinner with a group. The food is simply outstanding. The soup salad and chicken are all excellent but the fried rice is the absolute best. I have never had better fried rice anywhere. After you have enjoyed the main course get the green tea ice cream. I hate green tea but for some reason this ice cream is amazing.   If you like teppen yaki and don't want to deal with the bland food they serve at Benihana definitely give this place a shot. You won't be disappointed.
neg	I wish I had known this was closed as well. We camped out near here and thought would be a great photo opportunity- Alas the gates were closed the signs were hung- and the fence was BARBED.  First time I had seriously considered trespassing- it looked like such a great spot for old timey photos was tough to resist!
pos	I got to stay here for work and had the best time! They have so many pools. I would spend my afternoons in the smaller pools and have the pool all to myself. It was great! They let me send free postcards which was fun too. My room was beautiful. It was large and had great amenities.   Food was disgusting though. I didn't have access to a car so I was pretty limited to eating hotel food for a week. Everything I ordered was gross and I tried it ALL!  I thought customer service was fine--not great just adequate.
neg	HUGE MISTAKE.  My husband seemed to be coming down with something - and we were too busy for him to get sick.  I called Doctors Express to find out how much it would be for him to come in.  They told me that it was the cost of an urgent care visit - per my insurance card.  I asked if I could make an appointment they said \"no need.\"  Since my Blue Cross card doesn't mention the cost for urgent care I called Blue Cross - who told me $50.  My husband went.  They did nothing - he was probably just exhausted (and now also annoyed by his wife who talked him into going to see a doctor for nothing).  Two months later I received a bill for over $200.  HUGE MISTAKE.  I anticipate the telephone argument then a call to the AG then seeing if there is a class action suit in process for others in my position .... now I am the one exhausted.  Again HUGE MISTAKE.
pos	We went there yesterday a I enjoyed it. The atmosphere was fantastic because they had a tv plus they have a lot of pictures of Man V. Food when Adam Richman came here. The service is good because they waited for us to order and were very patient.   I ordered the Jewish Slider like Adam did but I didn't take the challenge. 1 order of Jewish SIiders are 3 sliders. The sliders were awesome. The meat was tender and really juicy. The cheese didn't really make a difference it just added a little flavor but the bun soft and chewy and buttery which tasted like pancakes without syrup and it was fresh. The potato pancakes put the lid on the jar. The potato pancakes aren't just a creative idea it was very crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. There are 3 reasons why this isn't a normal slider. Reason number one is the Potato Pancakes reason number two is the meat isn't a patty and grinded beef that made that slider interesting. Reason number three is that the cheese is melted. REALLY melted. I will go again because the sliders are amazing.
neg	This place is chaotic confusing and the people who work here are just plain mean.  Hands down it is the worst airport I have ever been to.
