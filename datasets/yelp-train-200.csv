pos	My wife took me here on my birthday for breakfast and it was excellent.  The weather was perfect which made sitting outside overlooking their grounds an absolute pleasure.  Our waitress was excellent and our food arrived quickly on the semi-busy Saturday morning.  It looked like the place fills up pretty quickly so the earlier you get here the better.  Do yourself a favor and get their Bloody Mary.  It was phenomenal and simply the best I've ever had.  I'm pretty sure they only use ingredients from their garden and blend them fresh when you order it.  It was amazing.  While EVERYTHING on the menu looks excellent I had the white truffle scrambled eggs vegetable skillet and it was tasty and delicious.  It came with 2 pieces of their griddled bread with was amazing and it absolutely made the meal complete.  It was the best \"toast\" I've ever had.  Anyway I can't wait to go back!
neg	U can go there n check the car out. If u wanna buy 1 there? That's wrong move! If u even want a car service from there? U made a biggest mistake of ur life!! I had 1 time asked my girlfriend to take my car there for an oil service guess what? They ripped my girlfriend off by lying how bad my car is now. If without fixing the problem. Might bring some serious accident. Then she did what they said. 4 brand new tires timing belt 4 new brake pads. U know why's the worst? All of those above I had just changed 2 months before!!! What a trashy dealer is that? People better off go somewhere!
pos	I have no idea why some people give bad reviews about this place. It goes to show you you can please everyone. They are probably griping about something that their own fault...there are many people like that.  In any case my friend and I arrived at about 5:50 PM this past Sunday. It was pretty crowded more than I thought for a Sunday evening and thought we would have to wait forever to get a seat but they said we'll be seated when the girl comes back from seating someone else. We were seated at 5:52 and the waiter came and got our drink orders. Everyone was very pleasant from the host that seated us to the waiter to the server. The prices were very good as well. We placed our orders once we decided what we wanted at 6:02. We shared the baked spaghetti calzone and the small \"Here's The Beef\" pizza so we can both try them. The calzone was huge and we got the smallest one (personal) and got the small 11\" pizza. Both were awesome! My friend liked the pizza better and I liked the calzone better. The calzone does have a sweetish sauce but that's how I like my sauce!  We had to box part of the pizza to take it home and we were out the door by 6:42. So everything was great and not like these bad reviewers. That goes to show you that  you have to try these things yourself because all these bad reviewers have some serious issues.
neg	Disgusting!  Had a Groupon so my daughter and I tried it out.  Very outdated and gaudy 80's style interior made me feel like I was in an episode of Sopranos.  The food itself was pretty bad.  We ordered pretty simple dishes but they just had no flavor at all!  After trying it out I'm positive all the good reviews on here are employees or owners creating them.
pos	Rosie Dakota and I LOVE Chaparral Dog Park!!! It's very convenient and surrounded by a lot of paths a desert xeriscape baseball fields ballparks and a lake with ducks.  The Scottsdale Park and Rec Dept. does a wonderful job of keeping the park clean and shaded.  You can find trash cans and poopy-pick up mitts located all over the park and paths.  The fenced in area is huge to let the dogs run play and sniff!
neg	I've eaten here many times but none as bad as last night. Service was excellent and highly attentive. Food absolutely horrible.  My expectation was they would serve a steak on par with their seafood. After all they were charging 39 bucks for a ribeye.  What I was hoping for was a 1- 1-1/2' thick steak cooked Pittsburgh style as I had ordered.  What I got a a 3/4 in thick piece of meat that was mostly fat gristle and in no way resembled Pittsburgh Style.  Salad similar to something you could get at Chick Filet Veggies blah. Bread basket ample but day old and if not it certainly wasn't fresh.   In addition to bad food we were crammed into a small room where we were nuts to butts with 6 other tables listening to conversations ranging from someone's recent bout with pinkeye and another couple who elected to speak entirely in French until the waiter showed up then it was like they turned off the French switch and suddenly began speaking English.   I've had it with this place. If I'm going to pay 150 bucks for dinner it'll be at Mortons or Maestro where the steaks are 1-1/2 in thick cooked to perfection and half of it doesnt wind up on the plate as fat and gristle
pos	General Manager Scott Petello is a good egg!!! Not to go into detail but let me assure you if you have any issues (albeit rare) speak with Scott and treat the guy with some respect as you state your case and I'd be surprised if you don't walk out totally satisfied as I just did. Like I always say..... \"Mistakes are inevitable it's how we recover from them that is important\"!!!  Thanks to Scott and his awesome staff. You've got a customer for life!! .......... :^)
neg	I have always been a fan of Burlington's deals however I will not be shopping at this one again. I went to return a belt... pretty simple. Instead I stood in the customer service line for 15 minutes thanks to an employee of Burlington buying/putting things on layaway. It took three other staff to help her out. There were no words said to me except \"Hold on\". I was pissed. When the lady was finally done the employee at the service asked \"what do you want?\" Serious help is needed there!  If you work in the area of \"customer service\" I think you should have some.
pos	Drop what you're doing and drive here. After I ate here I had to go back the next day for more.  The food is that good.  This cute little green building may have gone competely unoticed if I hadn't been driving down Palm Rd to avoid construction.  While waiting to turn onto 16th Street the \"Grand Opening\" sign caught my eye and my little yelping soul leaped for joy!  A new place to try!  It looked desolate from the outside but when I opened the door I was put at easy by the decor smell and cleanliness inside.  I ordered dinner for two to go.  The menu was awesome.  I loved seeing all the variety: poblano peppers mole mahi mahi mushrooms...something wrapped in banana leaves.  It made it difficult to choose something.  Here's what I've had so far: La Condesa Shrimp Burro and Baja Sur Dogfish Shark Taco.  They are both were very delicious meals but the shrimp burro stole the show.  So much flavor.  I snagged some bites from my hubbys mole and mahi mahi burros- mmmm such a delight.  The salsa bar is endless.  I really stocked up.  I was excited to try the strawberry salsa but it was too hot in fact it all was but I'm a big wimp when it comes to hot peppers. The horchata is handmade and delicious.  They throw pecans and some fruit in there too which is a yummy bonus!  As if the good food wasn't enough to win me over the art in this restaurant sho did!  I'm a sucker for Mexican folk art and Frida Kahlo is my Oprah.  There's a painting of her and Diego hanging over the salsa bar it's amazing.  All the paintings are great love the artist.
neg	Another night meeting friends here.  I have to laugh.  Waited another 20 minutes for my beer to be refilled at the bar.  A girl even took my empty without even asking if I wanted a refill.  A new brunette girl that I don't recognize left the bar and sat down with her guy friends on the customer side AT 9:25 ON A FRIDAY NIGHT.  Another bartender had to ask her to come back and work.  Management....  Pull your head out of your ass!  Sad to watch....  I need to talk my friends into another place!
pos	Nobuo shows his unique talents with everything on the menu. Carefully crafted features with much to drink. Start with the pork belly buns and a stout. Then go on until you can no longer.
neg	Not busy at all but took nearly 45 min to get our meal.  Ordered the trout and was shocked to see lots and lots of bones. Hmmmmm. Well asked the waitress about it and she said \"they try the best they can\"  hmmmmmm isn't this a \"fish\" restaurant?  They comped the trout but still not sure I would go back.
pos	The oldish man who owns the store is as sweet as can be.  Perhaps sweeter than the cookies or ice cream.  Here's the lowdown: Giant ice cream cookie sandwiches for super cheap.  The flavor permutations are basically endless.  I had snickerdoodle with cookies and cream ice cream.  It was marvelous.
neg	Yikes reading other reviews I realize my bad experience wasn't unique. As a server I make a very laid back customer. I like pretty much everything I eat and don't require a lot of attention from the waiter.   La Piccola Cucina would benefit from just one extra person in the front of the house. Our guy though adorable and friendly was too busy to refill our drinks and to remember to bring our appetizer (though charged us for it). The ahi tuna (highly recommended over the other fish options he said) was so overcooked it was the color and consistency of chicken. Like other reviewers mentioned he was frantic and made that clear to every customer. At one point I even saw him in the kitchen cooking - they need another person!   I left super stressed out from the experience which is very very unusual for me. You can either have bad service or bad food but not both.
pos	Wonderful Vietnamese sandwich shoppe. Their baguettes are great hot out of the oven with butter or in one of their many sandwich choices. They have a modest selection of baked goods along with some of the best egg rolls around. Bring cash or your ATM card as no credit cards are accepted but they have an ATM on premises.
neg	This is my first year participating in Arizona to sell clothing just wandering how busy its goona be in there ??? little worried can any one reply me ??
pos	They have a limited time thing going on right now with BBQ chicken pizza (not sure how long it's going to last) but let me just say it was amazing.  Probably THE best BBQ Chicken pizza I have ever had.  I have tried other things too like the tomato basil soup and many of their sandwiches ... very good very fresh - every time.    The 5 stars is for the pizza but if I were to rate Jason's Deli over all they would get about a 4.
neg	really I can't believe this place has received such high reviews from people.  my lady and i walked in and were greeted rather rudely by a pretentious bitch at the front with a monotone \"name please?\" instead of a warm friendly french welcome to this rather charming looking place. we didn't have a reservation which from the looks of how dead empty the place was didn't seem like a problem. until the hostess whisked through her reservation list and explained she'd try to \"fit us in\". it was 6pm the place had one other couple dining and we were informed that the next party was arriving at 7:30. we weren't really looking to hang out. it would have be awfully lovely if yelpers would have informed of the need to MAKE RESERVATIONS before going in here because if you don't you're automatically a piece of shit according to the staff. sorry i don't plan very much ahead. next time i will and it won't be here.  anyways after debating for a minute or two with herself the hostess decided we could \"squeeze in\" and sat us right on top of the other couple inside the restaurant. she informed us that we could cork our own wine for their low low price of 9 fucking dollars. in words only office space could adequately describe\"coup des tartes what is it exactly that you do?\".   the food was good nothing spectacular for $25+ a plate. we got a salad with apples and nuts and bleu cheese which was served warm. now this is the first warm salad i've had all of my life and by no means am i some sort of wordly food expert but i believe salad should be cold and crisp. not soggy and warm. yuck. the cordon bleu was tasty and filling however the wobbly table was an extreme annoyance when cutting through the chicken but it was solved (with no thanks to the staff) by placing a jack-in-the-box gift card under the leg. i will admit the mashed potatoes are some of the creamiest and best i've ever had. my lady got the pork tenderloin which had a strange peppery-sweet pairing which i didn't particularly care for. we were broke for desert so unfortunately we didn't get to try any tarts. you would think for a place that promotes itself as being so poise would get some fancier menus other than a $.15 piece of cardstock copied in bulk at kinkos.  this place was rather disappointing. i honestly thought it would be way more comfy and welcoming inside but it really wasn't. it presents itself as being so high class and french and oh-la-la wee wee but when it comes down to it it's still located in a tiny shack of a house at 16th street and highland. maybe if it were located in the biltmore i'd give it a bit more cred.
pos	okay this is the best place EVER! i grew up shopping at the one in los gatos and the one in Oakville. i was shock when i saw the best store in the world in Scottsdale and then not surprised at all. the have all the good stuff. from cheese down to wine. i can't tell you how happy i am that this store is here in Arizona. now if we could just get dean and deluca!
neg	I was really excited about this event maybe my expectations were too high because I was really underwhelmed.  Very little shade ran out of water by the time I got there at 1pm (other obligations) 20\% of the vendors were out of food and by the time I ate my way through some everyone else was already out.   60 bucks for that?  I don't think so.    And when I mentioned it to \"the person in charge\" he was patronizing invalidating and kept telling me how happy the chefs were.  Well I'm your consumer big guy.    Sorry Devoured wish it could have been better.   What food I did try was pretty good.
pos	This place shouldn't even be reviewed - because it is the kind of place I want to keep for myself...  =)
neg	The beach paradise of Ixtapa-Zihuatenejo awaited us....unfortunately so did a connecting flight in ARIZONA of all places...  Long story short....1/3 of our luggage did not arrive at our final destination various articles of our clothing are still missing as well as my cell phone charger...not to mention security forcing us to open sealed containers of my son's baby food and milk for litmus tests...  I looked on the bright side....at least we didn't get deported =)
pos	first time my friend and I went there... it was delicious!  The food garlic knots our favorite and of course the wine!  We will be going back ALOT!
neg	See the huge sign outside that says $2.50? Yeah that's for shirts only. I was caught off guard when I brought in my skirt and got nailed for about $3.79. As I sadly handed over my $5 bill the lady at the counter said a lot of people had told her they felt betrayed by the sign outside. No kidding. I had originally been heading down the street to Regal on 7th Ave.--who does a fine job in half the pickup time--for the \"advertised\" fake price here. Trying to make the best of it  I told the lady at least I'd learned they had an onsite alteration service and maybe that was worth a buck. UH OH. Picked up my skirt a few weeks later with some Jersey Shore-type chick at the counter and was told I owed another $3.79. I flat-out refused to pay twice. She screamed at me chased me to my car wrote down my license plate and said the police would be visiting. Ni-i-i-ice.
pos	I love this place! I have been coming here for ages. My favorites: Elsa's Chicken sandwich any of their burgers dragon chicken wings china's little chicken sandwich and the hot pepper chicken sandwich. The atmosphere is always fun and the art they display is very abstract but totally cool!
neg	Unless you are a regular or look like your wallet is fat don't expect the best service.  Entrees cost about 20-38 bucks and Anti pasta runs between 5-20 desserts are all 8 bucks unless you get aged balsamic vinegar.  They also have a big cheese selection.   I made reservations for this restaurant and they sat us by the back door.  The waiter never once explained anything on the menu or suggested a wine to go with our meal.  He didn't even tell us about the cheese menu except to check on the one we wanted.  The other waiter for a table near ours went out of his way to explain the menu and go as far as to tell his tables how to eat the cheese ( it comes with jelly's and such) .    My meal was good I had the duck.  She had the salmon which tasted very fishy.  Not fresh at all.  The wine was 40 bucks for a carafe ( maybe if we would have got a 100 dollar bottle we would have gotten better service)  The Dessert was good it was a rich chocolate cake with nuts and chocolate sauce. Nothing too special.    Overall the experience made the meal not worth the 115 bucks in these times not to mention they overcharged my girls card for the drinks at the bar.  If we dont want to give 25\% don't charge it plain and simple.    Just a warning reservations and customer service mean nothing.  We mentioned our complaints to the waiter and manager.  We received an apology but how bout comp our dessert or something.  Hyatt Gainey staff is also rude for the most part.    Two thumbs way down.
pos	I love love LOVE this place. My boss (who is into healthy eating) recommended this place. I went over with some highly skeptical friends and one dinner was enough to convert them into believers! The food here is so good! We had the Shrimp dumplings and the Onion tart as starters. We ordered the Shirataki noodles and street tacos as entrees. So also ordered the Kale-aid. All of the dishes were yummy.  I have gone back many times since then and have never been disappointed! I have gone after yoga to get some Kale salad or the chicken chopped salad. I always have to get the Kale aid.  Once a guy at the next table uprooted a whole plant by mistake (on the patio) and was highly embarrassed as was his date! Ever since I have very careful not to throw my arms around as I can be quite clumsy sometimes! I do NOT want to be banned from my favorite place for my clumsiness! I don't think I can live without True Food!
neg	Take your money elsewhere unless you've got kids.  I really try to like this place.  A family member signed me up for the discount card so I've been going more often but I just don't love it.  It's simply ok but the prices are outrageous.  And the sounds and animatronics are a huge distraction from the so-so food.  The cocktails are alright but again the price is not right.  The ony thing fun about the place for an adult is the gift shop and the light-up cocktail glasses (which cost extra.)  I've seen a lot of happy families in here though so I bet it's better if you have little ones to bring along.
pos	Disclaimer: Like many of you I am a sucker for charming little homes that have been re-purposed into restaurants. I am certain that this colored my opinion of Cibo.  That being said I absolutely love having lunch here the other day. I unknowingly arrived at 2:05 (5 minutes after they close between lunch and dinner) but was served anyway. I had the salscicia sandwich and a side of fruit. The sandwich was excellent served on perfectly crisp chewy saltimbocca bread. The sausage was flavorful and was complimented by roasted red peppers and onions. All this was finished off with a great quality mozzarella cheese. Really really delicious.  I should also say that the atmosphere here was friendly and  comfortable though a bit small. This would be a great place to hang out if you lived nearby.
neg	My friend kept telling me how good their lunches are... I tried it but it didn't do anything for me.  The sandwich tasted like something you can get at Safeway but twice the price.  For being called a Purveyor of Fine Foods I expected the food to taste like not just any ordinary sandwich.   What I had: Ham cheese with portobello mushrooms on a panini with 2 sides of pasta one was parmesan and the other was macaroni. Maybe it was the panini bread. I think the parmesan pasta was made there but I know for sure the macaroni was not made there it tasted like something I had at a picnic which was in a carton. It wasn't anything to brag home about.   I found out the head chef made my sandwich... keep him in the kitchen and away from the customers no personality whatsoever. I asked for his suggestion and his reaction was \"anythings good.\"   Normally when I go to AJ's I go for their desserts. Their desserts are fabulous and you can get individual servings at a reasonable price.  I can take an assortment home and have them for later.   Our company does use them for their catering and I've had many compliments on their dishes but pass on the lunches.
pos	Never having dealt with a Discount Tire in Phoenix before (only in Texas and their service has been great all the time) I came in not knowing what kind of service to expect. I was pleasantly surprised! The store had a good amount of parking and the store front was clean open and had adequate seating around the perimeters. There were already 5-6 people sitting and waiting for their cars to be finished and 2 people waiting infront of me to see a representative. All the guys working there were busy helping someone yet were saying hello to us and reassuring they'd get to us very soon. I didn't wait an unneccesary amount of time and then was helped by Wally. He inspected my tires recommended a plan of action gave me options and we headed back into the store. After I made my decision to replace 2 of the tires he checked their stock and unfortunately they didn't have them there. BUT he called another store and had them picked up for the next morning so I could just come back the next day to this same store and get those bad boys installed. Great! The prices were not as heafty (relief) and although there were a good amount of people the next day waiting for their cars to also be serviced it took exactly the amount of time they'd told me (45 min). They apologized for the wait but no need for that! The guy who helped me on the 2nd day (I'm sorry I forgot his name) was also very professional and great. I recommend this store and will be bringing my car here in the future most definitely. Thanks guys!  TIP: If you know you need to bring your car in you can make an appointment with them online. They take walk-ins but I believe it helps them manage their customers easier and that in turn benefits you.
neg	Absolutely horrendous.  This post office will lose your mail (repeatedly) laugh about it to your face lie about it blow it off make it seem like it's your fault and make you wish you had sent it UPS.
pos	(Un)fortunately for me lux is close to my house.  I walk there nearly every day and am much poorer because of it.  The coffee and pastries are amazing.  They always play really great music too!
neg	Other than the really great happy hour prices its hit or miss with this place. More often a miss. :(  The food is less than average the drinks NOT strong ( at least they are inexpensive)  but the service is truly hit or miss.  I'll pass.
pos	Fred M. pretty much said what I would say so I won't beat a dead horse.  I'll add though that they offer a wide variety of deep-fried quesadillas.    Did you catch that?  DEEP FRIED QUESADILLAS!
neg	Been here for many years but have seen a recent decline in quality service. Felt scolded by the bartender today at lunch. Felt disrespected as a customer. Service sucks stay away. \"bad service = bad review\"
pos	Alright I have been away from Yelp for quite some time and I feel that this place is fitting to be my comeback review...  Chicken and Waffles.  Yes chicken and M'Fin waffles.    In the ghetto?  Check Has sweet tea?  Check Has no-nonsense quick service?  Check Ridiculously long wait?  Check Best thing that I have eaten in the last year?  Check  I have to say not the best fried chicken I have ever had but pretty damn good- it could use more seasoning.  Now the waffles probably the best ever...  The waffles are deliciously soft inside a little crispy out with a wonderful cinammoness to them.  The seating is cramped but it doesn't matter as soon as your food is delivered your table goes quiet you get tunnel vision and after the first bite you are taken away to an orgy of goodness.  If you are in Phoenix this is a requirement.  Come real early or be prepared to wait.  Don't forget to order the Red Velvet cake and they have Kool-Aid if that fits your fancy.  Even after I came home from Arizona I couldn't stop talking about LoLo's for like 2 weeks.  Shoot two months later and I am still drooling thinking about it...
neg	This place is not there anymore.
pos	This restaurant is incredible and has the best pasta carbonara and the best tiramisu I've had in my life. All the food is wonderful though. The calamari is not fried. The bread served with dinner comes right out of the oven and the tomatoes are the freshest I've tasted outside of my mom's own garden. This is great attention to detail.  I can no longer eat at any other Italian restaurant without feeling slighted. This is the first place I want take out-of-town visitors I'm looking to impress.  The owner Jon is helpful friendly and really cares about providing a positive dining experience. He's spot on with his wine recommendations and he organizes wine tasting events which you can find out about by joining the mailing list or Facebook page.
neg	Rarely do I give a 1 star rating but after four attempts in four months to get my fax line and internet rolling I can honestly say they have earned this.  After finally showing up for a scheduled appointment the tech told us our internet was fine but we disagree because we are getting the same speed we had with Qwest in Cave Creek (SLOW)  and they are charging us $64 a month for what they call the upgraded 20mbs.  Furthermore I tried to send out a couple faxes after he left and the line is not responding.  Im going to drive down to the store tomorrow and demand that they remove the fees for service I have not received and just get efax.  As I noted in the first review we were excited to upgrade to faster internet so that makes this experience even worse.
pos	This an incredible church that embraces the principle that ......Christ Life Church exists to bring people into a life-changing relationship with Jesus Christ.  Three campuses allow Christ Life to reach into several locations...online Tempe and Casa Grande.   The wonderful children's and youth programs appeal to a wide perspective of people.
neg	What a load of absolutely hideous uninteresting crap.  Take every single one-star review written by Yelpers below copypaste them here and you will have a far more eloquent summary of my feelings on this place than anything I can come up with.  I have no reason to ever come here. Certainly not free will. The one time I did come here I was forced to by a friend who was meeting another friend.
pos	This is our favorite breakfast place. The food is good. They have the best biscuits & gravy of any restaurant I have eaten at. The wait staff is friendly. The only complaint I have is that Sunday mornings are packed so there can be a wait to be seated.
neg	Wednesday 7pm.  This place is your average over priced lack of taste chain food restaurant and this place was no different.   I have to say I was super disappointed as I have always heard rave reviews now I'm starting to question who I associate with and their taste in food.  Service=slow. Food=just tastes like salt Noise=loud and they do a dance...like a lot.  Go somewhere else and skip Joe's Crabs.
pos	I had looked at several invitation websites along with catalogs with no luck in finding just the right balance of wedding colors/design.  Thomas at Alphagraphics helped me every step of the way of designing and printing our wedding invitations and programs.  I knew I wanted a booklet-style but needed a little design creativity from Alphagraphics which they nailed!  I highly recommend Alphagraphics to anyone needing any print work done - not just wedding invitations.  Thomas and his crew are stellar!!
neg	I had not been to an Oregano's in like 10 years. They seems to be popping up all over here in AZ now so my buddy was in from out of town and he wanted to try so why not.  I'll tell you \"Why NOT\"... we has two thin crust pizzas... and I even hate to call them that. More like... crackers with melted cheese and some toppings.  That was some of the worst excuse for pizza I've ever had. Most of the fast-food delivery pizza I've had beats it -- and I do not like at all delivery pizza.  Maybe the pan pizza is better than the thin crust... god it could not be worse!  It only deserves one star for the good service... other than that is the another sub-par overpriced \"gourmet\" pizza joint.  If you want expensive and good pizza there are many good alternatives... Pizzeria Bianco Grimaldi's etc.
pos	I absolutely love this little spot! It's a great little known boutique with incredibly unique gift items that I don't have to drive clear out to Scottsdale to find. I've been shopping at Vignettes for about 8 years. Whenever I am in a quandary about what to get someone this is the first place that I head to. Mostly it is because of the wide range of specialty items that they have on hand. Whether it's something for the garden a gift for the new bride or baby a unique piece of art or heavenly scented candles - you will not be disappointed.  The owners / staff are super friendly and have always been more than willing to help find something within a price range or based on occasion / need. And they do the most amazing wrap jobs making gift giving even easier.  The final bonus is their annual Clearance sale. For three days each year they basically blow out their stock to make way for new finds. Ask to be put on their mailing list to ensure your have a heads up and get there early because long time customers like myself never miss it. : )
neg	I recently had a shit cleaned at the Intercontinental Hotel in Hong Kong. Not cheap. I only mention that because this place charged MORE to clean that suit - almost $30 for a two-piece suit after they tacked on their $6 \"designer brand\" surcharge (no I am not kidding). Despite branding as \"green\" the suit still reeked of solvent (the green silica-based solvents have never left an odor in my experience). No differentiation to justify these absurd prices - a lot of good alternatives in the area. Be warned!
pos	Came here with a large group a while back.  We were there to eat and have a beer before a concert there. It was a weekday so we made it to happy hour. Happy Hour pricing was fair. The food was pretty good. The very best thing there is the beer!  They had like everything on tap! MMMM!
neg	Where are the managers????   It took 1 1/2 hours for our meal to come out at 8:15 in the evening.  Items came out at different times so we couldn't all eat at the same time.  The asparagus tempura was inedible because they didn't cut the ends.  Waitress just took it away and did not comp us.  Waitress knew next to nothing about the sushi menu.  She sat and talked with the hostess the entire time instead of waiting on her tables.  Food was WAY over priced and I couldn't speak to my dinner companions because the music was way to loud.  One of the worst dining experiences in a long time.  Paid $70 for a dinner for 4 and went home hungry.  HORRIBLE!
pos	Beer...or Yoga?  Located in a small center just east of Four Peaks Brewery in Tempe (a reasonable distance from the light rail on Apache) is an amazing classy studio for the Mind-Body connection.  Mr. Mustachio had decided after doing a couple yoga classes with me at the ASU gym that he loved the stretch so pursued a class for a semester at ASU this Spring and had the pleasure of practicing with Tish Hegel. After seeing his body transform to only 16.2\% body fat all his jeans get too big on him and fill out his American Apparel briefs nicely I was super jealous. He raved about his teacher and I could tell he had de-stressed a lot since he started the practice.  Luckily she opened up a studio recently and it simply goregous. The waiting area is filled with yoga material and a very calming space with a remodeled bathroom and dressing rooms to change if coming from work/school. Not at all cheesy like the SouthWest Inst with the way too many angels imagery (creepy!). But the gem is truly the practice space. Hardwood floors high ceilings a beautiful staircase tasteful decorations and absolutely NO MIRRORS.    That is right- the only person staring at my pudge rolls is my teacher and who-ever isn't focusing on their tree posture-not the entire class! It really relieves a lot of stress  and helps me concentrate on how a posture feels as opposed to just looks.  As for Tish Hegel she is simply outstanding-she has so many credentials you have to read her biography for yourself. She has been practicing for a loooong time and her hands-on instruction and confident voice echoes in my ears even now (bring those shoulders down!).   So far I have done:  Ashtanga Inspired Flow (pretty intense really hurt for 3 days would recommend after getting into yoga for a while) Sivananda (ditto)  Focus Class (did a lot of bike riding and she focused on everybody's body issues and did the sequence right then and there for us and my lower back and knees felt amazing the day after) and this morning brought my friend to Kinetic Yoga: Morning Movement and Flow which kicked our 6am asses a little bit but we both felt amazing afterwards!  She does tons of modifications is always making sure we are okay and is just super personable.  I did the huge package since I didn't renew my ASU gym membership for this summer but you can do drop-in.   Now for the cliched Yoga Review ending:   NAMASTE!
neg	Still quite poor both in service and food. maybe I made a mistake and ordered Sichuan Gong Bao ji ding for what seemed like people from canton district. Unfortunately to get the good service U have to speak Mandarin/Cantonese. I do speak a smattering but try not to use it as I never feel confident about the intonation.   The dish came out with zichini and bell peppers (what!??)  Where is the peanuts the dried fried red peppers and the large pieces of scallion. On pointing this out all I got was \" Oh you like peanuts.. ok I will put some on\" and she then proceeded to get some peanuts and sprinkle it on the chicken.  Well at that point I was happy that atleast the chicken pieces were present else she would probably end up sprinkling raw chicken pieces on it like the raw peanuts she dumped on top of the food.   Well then  I spoke a few chinese words and the scowl turned into a smile and she then became a bit more friendlier.   Unfortunately I do not condone this type of behavior. It is all in poor taste...
pos	Figured it is time to write a review after going here for quite a few years for dinner on special occasions or just to have some of the best seafood and Bone in fillet around.   First off you have to understand that the cuts are top quality so you can order almost any steak off the menus and be dazzled by the flavor which is fantastic to the point that adding anything to it would destroy the integrity of the taste as is.  I mean the meat is perfection on a plate and this needs no other explaining.  If with friends or even your significant other you must start with the the seafood tower which can be order in many different ways to match your appetite and likes. When presented at the table you and your guests will be blown away at the quality of the seafood and rightly so as it is brought in fresh daily.  The sides are too awesome in their taste and quality and i suggest the Lobster mash or the Maestros Mash potatoes neither of which will leave you hungry in their own right but often wanting more :)   Wine selection is great and the atmosphere is top notch but topping it with some of the best servers in town makes this one of my favorites for entertaining.   you will not be disappointed.
neg	First I hope La Fonda management reads these reviews and takes steps to improve their restaurant.  Second we miss the bloody mary bar too.  Hubby & I visited LF a few weeks ago on a Saturday night for dinner. We asked the waitress a general question about a beer and she made something up that was ridiculously wrong.  Okay she doesn't know beer.  We liked the chips & salsa it was a good start then I took a sip of my water.  What the?  I know what Tempe tap water tastes like but this was weird.  The aftertaste made me cringe I couldn't drink it even with a slice of lemon in it maybe it was the ice.  Hubby ordered chicken enchiladas which he orders practically everywhere and it was so bad he didn't finish it.  My meal was not memorable either.  I wanted to love this place or at least like it.  We walked out of there terribly disappointed I doubt we'll go back.
pos	I can't describe to you how amazing these gourmet adult hot pockets taste! They literally MELT in your mouth- a few of my favorites are the Cajun Chicken Dill Salmon and the Stilton & Steak---Bon Appetit everyone! And don't forget about the all day everyday-$3 car bombs(you can't beat that price) their happy hour is amazing too!
neg	I'd say I've been to the Clubhouse a few times a year over the past five years or so. Does that make me the most knowledgeable person on the venue? By all means no. But there are some very common themes among the shows I've seen here even though the artists were different genres different crowds and even different times of year.   The sound quality is terrible. The last three bands that I have seen there (and have seen in other venues as well) all complained that they couldn't get the sound right on their monitors or in the house. To me that's a major turn off if the band isn't happy with their sound are they going to be very motivated to play? Maybe it's a slighted observation but it seems that the only bands that return to this venue are the ones that play music where the sound quality isn't...let's say \"sacrificed or as important\" (metal hardcore thrasher hip-hop whatever you call it).   The venue is also hot. I don't read the reviews of others before I review a location because I don't want my opinions to be skewed but I noticed someone said \"don't wear pants\" honestly that's a really good tip. The last show I saw here was in June. I know it's Phoenix in the summer suck it up. But when you exit the venue and it is noticeably and significantly \"cooler\" than inside the venue we've got issues can they not afford to run the a/c?   The answer to that question is maybe not. The bar is understaffed and patrons seem to be lined up 3+ deep all around. Sometimes you've got to spend money to make money. Hire more bartenders customers get served faster thus allowing them more time to consume the beverage and purchase more. That means you can sell more which means you will make more money! What a concept.   Hate to just destroy a business but hopefully they will heed the feedback constructively. Until then remember: if you've always wanted to hear the artist you are going to see in a low-fi format here's your chance if you have always wanted to forgo wearing those pantaloons I support you and finally you should craft a clever way to hide a flask since you won't get served although this might be difficult sans bottoms.
pos	So very Portlandia in its hipsterness and decor. Premium coffee roasted in-house in the middle of the desert no less! Who would have thunk it.  Baristas were profesh and friendly. They even warmed up our pastries upon request. Perfectly foamed milk and fruity noted espresso. I hope this place has a long life in Scottsdale where great coffee is few and far between.
neg	Not that any SBUX is worth going out of your way for but this one is worth skipping. The service I've experienced each time I've been is pretty dang poor and the drinks always seem quite cold.
pos	Awesome subs clean and friendly well priced.
neg	How does this restaurant generate so many 4 and 5 star ratings?   I know it was on the food channel but honestly the food was sub-par. Maybe it was just an off day but I have a feeling it wasn't. The prices were not outrageous but it wasn't cheap either. The atmosphere was nice if very cafeteria like.  But the food was way way too \"greasy.\" And bland. And my stomach now aches after eating there....
pos	I LOVE Chic Nails!  I used to go to Tip & Toes on 48th street and Ray Road until one day they were \"too busy\" to take my friend and I in for pedicured. We discovered Chic Nails and have been doing all of our manicures and pedicures there since.   The staff is extremely friendly and they give the best pedicures for a very reasonable price. I highly recommend this nail salon over any other!  P.S. It is extremely close to CK's Bar & Grill to go for happy hour after! :)
neg	My wife and I live around the corner hadn't eaten here in a few months. We got food for take out Mongolian beefkung po chickenpad Thai noodles.  Mongolian beef there were more white onions then scallions and it was very bland. Kung po chickenlots of white meat chicken the whole dish only had one peanut and the taste of this dish was non existent. Very very Blah... Pad Thai noodlesthe dish was dry and came out of the container in one giant clump. It tasted like plain noodles i was glad I had peanut sauce in the fridge toadd to it. Then it was edible .... We will not be going back to G@S.. Very disappointed !!!! From now on it will be Jade palace on 92nd street. For take out Asian !!!!  Do yourself a favor go elsewhere !!!!
pos	After the Padres Spring Training game we had reservations at Don & Charlie's in Scottsdale .  None of us had been here before and it came highly recommended by my dad.  As soon as you walk into Don and Charlie's your eyes start feasting on all the signed baseballs down the left wall.  Now everywhere you look from floor to ceiling and even the ceiling itself is covered in memorabilia and autographed items from athletes of all sports and other celebrities.   Besides the amazing assortment of sports artifacts I especially like the Cactus League Beer List which pairs a beer with each city that has a team in the Cactus League.  Colorado = Coors Light  Texas =Shiner Bock Chicago =Old Style and San Diego =Stone IPA etc.  Also worth mentioning is the complimentary chopped liver platter with rye bread and bagel chips they bring as soon as you are seated.  I had the ribs with coconut shrimp combo which was great. I wasn't thrilled with the side dish: potato's au gratin which is a $2.50 upcharge.  They also bring a huge bowl of cole slaw with each entrée or you can choose soup which comes in a smaller bowl than the cole slaw!  We were too full for dessert and as we walked out this place was packed!  I found myself trying to take in as much memorabilia as possible and then on one side of the crowded lobby there sat Willie Mays himself.  He was signing his book (or a baseball) for a $200 charitable donation to his foundation. Needless to say I 'm not bringing home any memorabilia myself!
neg	There really isn't much I like about Michael's to begin with - I especially dislike them for using my name and putting on such an inferior showing - but this location was a particular disaster.  Clean up your aisles for goodness sake I feel claustrophobic with all the crap hanging around - its like the clothing section at K-Mart but possibly worse.
pos	Best food super friendly staff and great prices. Love it!
neg	oK first i broke my promise to myself and went here again i figured by now things have got to be better. i ordered something that i wouldn't care if it was cold French Toast. ok so the french toast is good. but it wasn't worth waiting 40 fucking minutes to get it. and on top of it. my friends food was cold again. one of them would rather eat glass then eat at this place so refused to order a cold meal but since my other friend was paying she said fuck it i'll go.  well she ordered toast and some sausage as sides. and my other friend ordered the mish mash his review of the place is more generious then mine but he's only been there once and said it wasn't so bad. lol.  so anyways toast soo cold the butter couldn't even melt. and cold sausage to boot. the friend with the mishmash lol. i saw the bottom of the bowl and it was all a weird watery substance at the bottom. how hard is it to drain poached eggs before dumping them in a bowl?  i was going to give palatte 3 stars based on the french toast but it was hardly warm. i so badly want to like this place cause it's close and Matt's is always packed.  can i please get a breakfast place in the roosevelt area that is large enough to seat more then 20 people and serves good breakfast?
pos	Christy is an amazing cake artist.  She has an impressive portfolio as she has a flair for creativity.  Her cakes are amazing and are truly one-of-a-kind.  She also has several delicious cake flavors to choose from or she can create one for you.   She has made several cakes for our family and I have been impressed with everyone of them.  I was also excited to see her compete on TLC's Ultimate Cake Off show early this spring.  If you're looking for a sculpted cake or one that will be the center of attention at your next party then I recommend you call Phoenix Cake Company.
neg	They have some rude employees its unbelievable. I'm trying to give business to them and ordered 6 smoothies and the cashier and her employee gave me a dirty look. Not customer friendly. At all.
pos	After driving down a teeny dimly lit road and coming across what looked like a medical office building in the 60's my husband and I found the amazing Fuego Bistro. We had a perfect meal there. Amazing ambiance twinkly lights in the courtyard live musician. Great wine. Food was so unique and delicious- I'd describe it as Southern-Spanish fusion. This meal was the highlight of our trip to Phoenix.   If you live in Phoenix you have no excuse to not come here. I live in Chicago and I'm sure I'll be back.
neg	I really don't get why everyone is raving this place.  I've been here twice and ordered the carne asada burrito.  The portions are really small for the price that they charge.  There is too much tortilla for the meat.  I think this place is overrated and that there are better places for carne asada in the valley.
pos	It's just like pizza bianco without the wait. This pizza is a 9.9999 and bianco is a 10. This place has a much larger menu and their deserts are to die for.   If bianco has more then a 30 min wait just drive and or walk here.
neg	I have had it with the meat department at Whole Foods Market on Scottsdale Rd & the Mayo Blvd. They really suck.  I gave them another chance (out of desperation really) and they blew it!  I am so disappointed.  I purchased some turkey breasts there (3 of them) at around $30.00 for a 4 lb breast. I came home froze two and cooked one. It smelled but my husband insisted that it was the smoked smell of being in the butcher case with all the other meats.  I trusted his opinion and cooked it. Upon slicing it up for dinner I found that the free range turkey was very fatty. It was gross but no one got sick luckily.  Well now I just thawed out another one and the same thing but worse. It stinks like the rotting dead animal it is. It is definitely bad.  And it gets even worse! As I inspected it and opened up the two breasts (Whole Foods puts two breast together with a net to make one large one) I pulled out about 8 inches of thick fatty I don't even know what from it. Let's just say it definitely LOOKS like the dead animal it is too. What ever that stuff is it is all gray and rotten.  They are basically stuffing their Turkey Breasts with junk to make more money. I have had it with them!   I am not surprised. They have always been trouble. Frank the manager there is really not the kind of guy one would trust with food. His is kind of creepy and gives off a dirty \"I don't care\" attitude.  I spent over $100.00 there on Turkey (ground & whole) and he (Frank) still charged me for the breast bones - and another employee told me that they usually just throw them in the trash!  The meats at this butcher department cannot be trusted. The manager there cannot be trusted and has failed every time. It is really gross; top dollar for top trash! My husband thinks the manager is getting some sort of incentive for selling the \"questionable meat\" instead of throwing it out!    I am still nauseous from the smell sight and from touching all that gray rotting gross stuff. BLEECH!!! I think I ate that in the last one!
pos	As mentioned earlier the best thing about this place is the super cheap but super delicious lunch bentos.  You get a main dish rice salad and an orange for under $4. If that's not enough you can get double meat for a buck or two more.  I highly recommend the ginger pork or the katsu.  My friend I normally go with is a big fan of the white fish (fried or grilled).  The sushi here isn't bad.  It's nothing super special but I don't come here for the sushi so it's not a big knock against the place.  As they would say on ebay: A+++ Great Seller! Would eat here again!!!
neg	just say no.  this place is truly awful.  too bad it's taking up valuable space on monroe.
pos	'twas the night before booyah and all the through the city people were piecing  some pretty shitty costumes together at savers good will george w bush clintons bill and hill jay-z & beyonce biden and obama even saw kanye oprah super mamma yep octomom brad pitt & jolie and men as madonna and lynn sue cooney  i went to Easley's to see what they had of course it was madness every kid mom and dad crammed into the isles pulling on wigs vampire masks and noises of pigs all being assisted  by the yellow tee'd staff so very helpful no panic just laughs \"yes we have liberace in fact we have two try both of them on i'll grab 'em for you\" they found me a boa a wig and make up took just fifteen minutes case opened and shut and all around me this repeated itself the people rolled in pleased people rolled out into the darkness parties around town wonder how many were out gettin' down in get ups from Easley's i'm guessing a ton so check out Bert Easley's make up magic fun bright yellow building south side of mcdowell since nineteen sixty four makin' halloween howl
neg	Food middle of the road... The staff is rude.. Seems like it starts with the owner. I think she makes the staff pay for everything that goes wrong so in turn they dont want to fix issues with poor wrong food etc.  I think she tends to forget the customers are actually what keeps a business open. For a long time it was the only choice in the area. Now there are multiple choices.  If your in the area Chili's or Connolys is much better choice in my oppinion.
pos	Took my fiance' there for Valentine's day/ Birthday.  I did a lot of research of romantic places around the Valley and this one really caught my eye.  Immediately after walking through the door you'll notice a dark and romantic ambiance with a lot of candle light.  Seating is a bit tight but it wasn't bad enough for me to give it a lower review.  We began with an appetizer called \"Table side guacamole\" which was incredible to say the least.  It literally is made in front of your table.  Then it was onto the main dish... Build-your-own  Pork tacos.  Talk about tender meat!!  The shoulder of pork literally fell right off onto the fork.  The tortillas were exceptional and so was the tasty sauce which included pineapple glaze.  So the food was absolutely delicious...but the service was equally impressive.  My water level never reached the bottom of the glass the entire night and I drink plenty!  Everyone was incredibly nice and cheerfully said \"Happy Valentine's Day!\" and \"Happy Birthday!\" to my fiance' which made the experience even better.  A fantastic place that I'll have no problem recommending to others to visit!
neg	If there was a way I could give this restaurant NO stars I might have.  The chips and salsa are the ONLY thing that requires a star here.  The service was less than average the food was hotter than the surface of the sun and the drinks were teeny tiny (and didn't much taste like alcohol).  My husband ordered a green chile dish and it came smothered in red sauce when he asked the waiter if it looked green or red the server said \"nope that's what green looks like\".  WOW!  Sorry but I don't think I will be returning.
pos	I have had a great experience every time I have been there.  The food is hard to beat and the service was pleasant.    Portions are reasonable not huge (I'm a big feller) and I was satified every time I ate there.    Very pleasant environment clean spacious and calm.
neg	One stop has one goal and that is to get the $80. diagnosis fee and split.  Francisco told me i needed to spend over $1300. for parts the manufacturer only charges $316 for. Stay away! I intend to file a complaint with the Attorney Generals office today hopefully they will stop this nonsense.
pos	I love this restaurant!! I have been a fan of the Newport Beach location for years. Scottsdale definitely did not disappoint! The staff is friendly and knowledgeable. The drinks are fresh (worth the extra wait for the tasty Cucumber Jalapeño marg). And the food? Goes without saying it's CRAVE worthy. This is a new location so I expected the usual growing pains. But overall a great dining experience. Welcome to the neighborhood SOL Cocina!
neg	this another place that i would give no stars to if possible.  it's been on the corner of mill and university for as long as i can remember which is impressive since nothing older than ten years has been able to withstand the rent increases and even more impressive because i don't know a single person who goes there.  i went in there one time for drinks and walked past one of the foulest salad bars I've ever seen. for some reason it's right by the door. instead of walking in to see a hostess stand you walk right into this brown mess of vegetables.  after seeing that first off i wouldn't dream of ordering food here. the place is also dark and dirty and there's never anyone inside of it.  seriously I'm really curious how this place survives. awesome little neighborhood wing and live music joints like long Wong's get torn down for high rise condos yet gross ghost town ruby Tuesdays hangs on the corner of main and main of Tempe. what is wrong with the world?
pos	That darn Smokehouse burger is awesome. 5 stars.   The smoked corn was a little Meh... it was oily like not butter oily... not a huge fan of the texture either. I like corn crunchy and it was not.   Service was great.   I did see an unmentionable bug running around near the back entrance towards the chicken rotisserie thing but bugs have to eat too right? (still 5 stars lol)
neg	1 star for service but the food is not ok :( they literally put 4 pieces of chicken on my taco. I let that go & figured was a mistake. When I went again ordered different item & same result. Little to no meat. I will not be going back.
pos	Very friendly and knowledgeable guys.
neg	I was here for a conference and saw their sign for a $10 lunch special which wasn't available that day.  Took over an hour to just get a lunch salad.  The waiter had major attitude. Avoid this place!
pos	I have been here several times now and have never had a bad experience yet.  Good food good service; no complaints.   Still have never made it here for happy hour but their specials during that time seem like quite a deal.  The staff are always friendly and seem to remember us from one visit to another.  I've only ever eaten sushi here but they have a lot of other menu items that I would like to try at some point but I always turn to the sushi as it has always been good and fresh.  I would recommend trying this restaurant.
neg	My family and I ate here just a few days ago. It was an experience that left me yearning for more out of a restaurant I have seen so crowded over the years and decided to try with a group of 7 of us in the family. First off we got there at 10 am and were missing only two in our party so we had to wait to be seated which was fine. Once the rest of our party showed up at 10:07 we were not seated until after 10:30. When we were seated we were all scrunched together at a medium sized table that would comfortable seat 5 adults. Well there were 7 of us total and needless to say it was very tight! The waitress stated that we could take our water and go wait back up front for a bigger table but we were looking at roughly 40 minutes of waiting again!!! Seriously? We ordered drinks first and the waitress brought my father his tomato juice and almost spilled it on him but instead spilled it all over her hand. Then she sat the glass down in front of him with juice on table and all over glass and left! She never came back with a wet towel to clean up her mess!! We all ordered and the food arrived quickly. This was the only part of the experience that was good sadly to say. We received our food order for 7 of us within 15-20 minutes which was excellent. My uncle and grandmother both had charred toast (it was black not just black around the edges) . The bacon looked like dried strips of hard leather. Overall none of us will be returning to this place! It was is so overrated. We are headed back to RANDY'S here in Scottsdale to do our next family breakfast.
pos	I'm from Chicago so I'm picky with my pizza--this place does it right (NY style)! I love the \"hole in the wall\" feel. Every customer that walked in was a regular which was a good sign. I ordered the Mozzarella sticks and a large Monster Pie (Sausage pepperoni bell peppers onion and cheese). The mozzarella sticks took a little while to come out but they were cooked to perfection. They also threw in a few garlic knots which was awesome. The pizza was unbelievable--I think the crumbled sausage really did it! They have great deals like large pie & 20 wings for $20 which I definitely will be taking advantage of during football games on Sunday. Glad to have found a new place where I can also be a regular!
neg	I was severely mislead by Frank A's \"It's hot but the food ain't bad.\" review.  It was very cold and by far the worst food I've ever eaten.  You would have to drag me here in cuffs to get me to return.
pos	Perhaps it was foolish for me to give La Condesa only four stars at first given the fact that I really liked it.  What can I say?  I'm critical by nature.  I knew I was going back soon so I felt like I had to save the last for a return visit.  Well it just got it.  This place is fantastic.  In fact if CenPho lets this one go under I will personally hold all of you responsible; watch out for a citizen's arrest if I ever see you.  However that is unlikely to happen because the food is damn tasty.    Today the Oaxaca black mole chicken taco had me swooning topped with pickled onions; the chicken is tender and simmered in the lovely sauce.  The Soronan carne asada taco char-grilled over mesquite charcoal is no slouch either; I'd rate it right up there with some of my favorites in town.    Go to this place; I have a feeling I'll be here at least weekly.  When and if they ever get a beer/liquor license...probably more.
neg	Would have to agree with Rana A below... I think she said it best  Actually I had several folks tell me this place was lousy before I went... it even fell below my already low expectations...  Given that I just left the real Barcelona (in Spain)- part of me was truly crying inside that night. OK I gotta admit- everytime I tell someone I was just in Barcelona (the city) and they say \"you mean the one in Scottsdale\" there is a part of me that wants to just pack my bags and fly back...
pos	Great place for brunch or to relax with a coffee. Their hot chocolate is amazing.
neg	when i worked in retail my paycheck was spent before i got paid. therefore i relied heavily on coupons and splitting meals w all of my other poor college friends.  well i hit the jackpot. $15 coupon for a FEAST. the picture on the coupon showed everything we would get: a huge steak shrimp and lobster PLUS 2 sides. there were 3 of us- this was PLENTY.   it was prom night too so we were initally fooled with how popular it was. popular for prom girls with light up clear shoes (not even lying) if that says anything about the crowd for you...  our waitress stops by our booth and just stares at us. one of my friend kinda looks around at me and our other friend then back at the waitress. 'ill have a diet coke?'  then our waitress writes it down and doesn't say anything but looks at my other friend.  i lost it and started laughing. why isn't she talking to us? this is so weird.   we ended up asking for a different waitress then found out the coupon was a big fat liar. you didn't get all of that. it just says you do but you don't. the food ended up being nasty. probably one of the worst meals ive ever had.   as we're leaving susy talks a lot waitress trips over my friend and it was all too awkward bc i couldn't control laughing.   awful food awful service AND the bathrooms were some of the grossest i had ever been in.   if wal-mart ran a restaurant this would be it.
pos	Hands down the best breakfast I've ever had anywhere. It definitely feels like home cooked breakfast. I've never been to this place on the weekend when it isn't packed out the door. I'm not the only person that loves this place!
neg	HELLISH HELLISH SUMMER WEATHER (March thru October) it hurts my lungs to breath.  I couldn't get transcripts because I had a parking ticket I needed to pay. The problem is... *i DON'T OWN A CAR I don't drive I don't even have a drivers license*!! ~*~*-- aside from that one minor incident~*~*  I paid 9000 USD a semester to receive a so and so education. I graduated with a magna cum laude. I have attended other universities. However I couldn't help but notice the gap in the quality and variety of classes offered.  For example you have to be a finance major to take upper level interesting finance classes.  Business school was so and so a lot of repetition. Very little hands-on and help with internships. Way too much groupwork and free-riding. They do not have many good employers at their semi annual recruiting events.  Oh and professors rarely teach the courses. They have their teaching assistants teach us.  Also there is a lack of bridging classes between lower level and upper level classes.  Junior year when you get admitted into the \"professional program\" the level of the classes and transition isn't too smooth.  The campus tutoring program is pretty helpful for general classes if you're having trouble with classes (usually lower level)  There are not enough chairs/desks in some classes. The students sit on the floor and cram on the stairs in the lecture halls.  Also the classes don't teach you how to think critically which I think is crucial in college. Please don't waste your money especially those of you from out of state. Its not worth it.  Expect to wait in line wherever you go. ASU accepts way too many people. It would prolly accept my cat and my baby sister who barely talks if we threw money at them.  Thus its very difficult to get myself into the classes I need. The advisors are walking advertisements of the business school. They are not informed enough to advise you.  I got dropped from two required prerequisite courses so I could not move on to the next level.... even after pre-registration. I got screwed and ended up having to take one more semester to graduate.  Tuition rose from 6000 a semester in Fall of 2003 to 9000 + in Fall of 2007. Gross!!  One thing I liked was the student theatre performances. The admission $ was reasonable and quite entertaining.  The College of Architecture and Environmental design studios are pretty good and has good security.  ASU is not the most safe neighborhood. I have been approached by many shady people.  do NOT live on campus. Especially the dorms on north campus. They are beyond crappy and overpriced. You have to split your room with a room mate in most cases for undergrads. The \"freshman year experience\" bullsh*t they pull on you don't buy it. and Please PLEASE please don't move into Manzy Hall (Manzanita; 15 stores with triangular windows).  I lived here my froshy year and its the dirtiest (rats) unhealthy (mold pot circulation) most promiscuous place on campus.  Again please don't bother wasting your money especially if your an out of state or international student.  Hope this helps.
pos	This place is fantastic!  We went in on Sunday the 29th of July around 5:00pm. The guy behind the counter told us to enjoy ourselves take our time ask if we had any questions. We wandered around for a bit I found a bottle of Argyle bubbly that I wanted and then began to stare with lust in my eyes at the selection of Absinthe.   Girlfriend wandered over to ask the guy to recommend a white that wasn't a Chard as we both really don't like buttery oak anything. He took a few cues from her and found a great bottle of white which we drank with great glee last night.   This was a test for the guy behind the counter. She didn't set a price limit just said \"show me your favorite.\" He could have done what many others have in the past and shown us a $50 bottle but instead he showed us a kick ass bottle at the $14 price point. This is the mark of a good wine seller. Find you what you want without bending you over on the price. Yes sometimes I want to spend $400 a bottle but not all that often. I'd rather get my drink on at the price he found and he turned us onto a white we both REALLY liked which is super rare as we have very different tastes.  We'll absolutely be going back to buy more fermented grape from this place!  Prices are on par with Total Wine but what you're really paying for is the help of someone who knows what they sell and likes their job. Great job Sportsman's see you next Sunday for afternoon drinking!
neg	Tried to get ahold of this dude to no avail. No personal message on his answering machine at all. Website sucks for information to let me know what sorta work or quality thereof he does. I tried to call here @ 6:53pm tonight and again...no one picks up the phone. So fed up with flaky contractors. Do they want work or not?
pos	Recently moved back to Mesa I have been on the hunt for a place to get a good sandwich and fresh bread. This place now tops my list of places in the East Valley to get a good sandwich. My first sandwich was the Atlantic Haddock Provencal. A sandwich made with seared lightly breaded haddock sliced hard-boiled egg fresh basil romaine lettuce tomato Provencal tartar sauce on a grilled Brioche roll. The brioche was amazing. It was light and fluffy. The haddock was perfectly cooked with just the right amount of breading and the vegetables were fresh and in perfect proportions as to not overpower the bread and haddock. Sometimes when you go to a sandwich shop they overload it with everything else that the meat and bread are just there to accessorize the vegetables and sauce. This was perfectly done. The atmosphere is pleasant and open with nice music as the light smell of fresh bread in the background salivates me. This is a must-visit lunch time destination. Dinner review shortly.
neg	food is ok but service is very slow!
pos	What a wonderful night. It didn't start out that way. I found this restaurant on yelp not realizing that it was sixteen miles from the hotel my wife and i were staying at. I heard the grief all the way there. \"Come on honey it's an adventure!\".   We arrived and were greeted warmly and shown right to our table. Zach our waiter was right there to offer us drinks and appetizers. We had the Summer Rolls and they were delicious!   I explained to  Zach that I was allergic to wheat and he brought us a special \"gluten free\" menu the owner had created for those of us who are allergic to wheat. Zach even brought us some special wheat-free dipping sauce for the Summer rolls. He showed great care provided great customer service  and the sauce  was delicious!  The portions were good sized and the presentation was beautiful. But the wonderful tastes and personal service made the night special. Oh the bathrooms were clean too. Thanks Zach and thanks Malee's. It was a great night my wife and I look forward to repeating. (Yes she admitted after dinner that the drive was worth it.)
neg	Have the owners from here ever even had a bagel from back east? Certainly doesn't taste like it and they charge double what they do back east too. No thanks. The search for a good bagel continues for now I'll just keep having them shipped straight from NJ.
pos	I am a way more frequent visitor of the bell rd location but sometimes I have to travel downtown for work. When I do I make my route pass by this place because I have to have dutch bros.  The guys at the bell location are pretty familiar with me by now but these guys still treat you as if you are there best customer. And it's the best coffee I've ever had.
neg	We went here for Mother's Day based on the positive reviews and had a pleasant experience.  Good food good service good ambiance.  We came back here for Father's Day and had a very unpleasant experience; the worst display of management I have ever encountered!  Apparently our order was never put in from the server or there was some sort of \"computer malfunction' they claimed but we waited at the table for 45 minutes after ordering no food nothing.  The server obviously recognized the mistake and kept checking in with us and apologized for the unusually long wait (did I mention the restaurant was half empty I wonder why!) and she did offer to comp our coffee drinks.  But the infuriating part was when we finally complained to the manager because we could not figure out why the ridiculously long wait she came over to our table did not properly introduce herself sat down and pointed to the man-held computer system and TOLD US we had only been waiting 15 minutes.  Really?!?  You're coming over to tell us how long we have been waiting???  It was so rude and disrespectful she was trying to argue her point to us which clearly showed that the server did not put in our order immediately which is probably why the server apologized to us umpteen times!!!  It was the most ridiculous display of what NOT to do as a manager.  I have been in management and customer service for over 12 years and this was clearly a Management 101 mistake.  She never apologized or tried to rectify the situation but when you come out to your customers in fighting mode you really cannot rectify that!    Needless to say unless this restaurant starts to provide better training to their managers and team members or hires a new manager we will NOT be coming back here again.
pos	Even more great news....on Tuesdays there is a special of 35c per ounce. Not that I needed another incentive...but this is GREAT.
neg	I never got a chance to try the food because I was so turned off by the way I was treated. My family and I will be waiting for a table across the parking lot at The Cheesecake Factory.
pos	Where to begin?  This is my favorite Mexican food establishment ever. I've been frequenting Carolina's for years and never once have I been disappointed. Some might compare it to Filiberto's or any of those [insert surname here]berto's but this is on a whole different level.  Atmosphere-wise it's one step above a sketchy hole-in-the-wall but the food makes up for everything the appearance of the place lacks. I don't know their secret but their beans the tortillas the salsa... it's all to die for. And IT'S. SO. CHEAP. Like seriously I'd dish out more money for this food but the fact that it really is that cheap is the icing on the cake.   It's almost always busy but it's always worth the wait. Always.  If you haven't gone... you're missing out.
neg	Here's the 1. 2. 3...  1. Great Food. I love hot New Mexico style food. Good job. 2. They have a little brewery and make 3 house beers. Unfortunately they're all shitty. 3. They could REALLY improve the service. No Bueno!   We'll be back for the food. It might be take out next time though!  4-17-11 Update: Some asshole who was clearly affiliated with Arribas contacted me via private message to slam me for my review. I hope the yelp police find you and pull you off the site. More importantly I hope more people read my review and stay away from this restaurant. Good Food folks just get it to go! To Bryan L. and the rest of the gang over at Arribas....Go EFF yourselves! You get one star and NO more of my money!!!!!!! Learn how to work Kid!
pos	I just got back from an Arizona spring training vacation and one of the highlights was definitely the Desert Botanical Gardens.  We came really close to skipping on a visit altogether because it was 5:00pm but decided to give it a shot...it was worth it!  I was a little disappointed that the Butterfly Pavillion had closed for the day at 5:00pm and several walking areas were being used for weddings/receptions (who could blame these people??) but still got to see a lot of beautiful desert plants and wildlife.  We managed to get in for free not sure if it was because of the time of the day or all the people just walking in for the weddings though which totally made the park that much more fun.  I am not sure I would have gotten as much enjoyment out of it if I'd had to pay $5 to get in...  The little desert rat-sqirrels and rabbits were totally fun to try to find hiding in the many different plants and burrows.  I felt like a little kid ooh-ing and ah-ing at the different varieties of cacti and desert wildflowers and have to give this place the ultimate rating .  If you're ever in Arizona please give this place a try it's very well put together and a beautiful site to see.
neg	My husband and I have Been meaning to go in here and see if it was anything like hong kong gourmet so yesterday for lunch we decided to give it a try. Huge mistake! The food was literally inedible everything was either too cold or burnt to a char nothing tasted good. We decided to try the desert and the cream puff (I'm unsure how you can mess that up) was petrified and the cream was so gross I spit it out. The smell of the flan actually made us gag we had such an awful time I complained to the manager. She didn't even seem to care and gave us 20\% off of a lunch we didn't even eat. We were disgusted by this place and we will never ever go back. Don't do it you will regret it!
pos	Being Indian and having grown up in London I have been pretty spoilt for Indian food. Imagine my dismay when I moved to Phoenix! I've tried many different places here in town desperately trying to recapture the memory of a good London curry house but each time I've left either disappointed or clutching my guts fearing what may come.  Couple of friends introduced me to this place a few months ago and I'm stoked. It's not as good as the stuff back home. And I'm sure you can get better in San Francisco or New York. But if you are looking for something closer to home you can't go wrong.  Plus its got the real live Indians eating in there too. Can't be bad!!
neg	Service was horrible and food was mediocre at best~ won't be going back
pos	Gaylee is great! She is super sweet and so professional! Her work is amazing. I found her through one of those online deals and now I am convinced that I will never go elsewhere. Keep up the great work!
neg	Refused to call me a cab because I had a phone.
pos	The praise and worship with Pastor BJ just sets up a God Filled service with the charismatic and awesome Pastor Maiden ... Going the Past 18 months has made our Marriage Stronger and Faith Magical
neg	I waited 45min and ended up with a tiny gross little serving of tortilla with vegetable scraps thrown in it served in a aluminum take-out box. The tables are folding tables like the kind you play beer pong on. And they have pictures of kids and babies on the walls and signs asking people to send in pictures of their kids for the walls too which has nothing to do with Asian/Mexican cuisine it creeped me out.
pos	I come here probably at least once a week. The prices are right there's a good variety of \"ethnic\" food the cashiers are quick and friendly and they're just helpful. I locked myself out of my car when having a space-cadet moment and they let me use their phone to call AAA to bail me out.   Fresh flowers + great selection of wine and cheese + all the essentials   They deal is that they cut out the middle man to get great prices for quality products and they don't have sales because they always sell their products at the best price possible. =) GO TJ'S!
neg	Totally dissapointed.  I had purchased a coupon from TravelZoo to try out this restaurant which given its location I would have thought it was going to be very upscale and we were expecting a WHOLE LOT MORE.   The Service was great but the food not worth it.  The restaurant itself is very outdated very 80's.   My husband and I had the crab cakes for appertizer.  They were cold when they were served.  We told our waiter who in turn told the chef and the message was passed back to us that she appologized.    My Husband ordred a 12oz New York Strip ala carte for $29.95 6 oz of that was pure fat!  and for the price you would expect to get more meat than fat!  I ordered a wild mushroom pizza which was OK.   This place needs an over haul in a major way if they want to make any money at the restaurant which for a Saturday night at 7pm when we went was empty.  I think the highlight of the meal was the bottle of cabinet!
pos	I have only gotten the cafe sua da (iced coffee) here but it's the best I have had yet. When you walk in there is always fresh coffee lined up in cups on the counter ready to be mixed with sweetened condensed milk. I don't get to Mesa often but when I do I go here for the wonderful rich dark and creamy coffee. This is strong stuff; that first sip is so good. The richness full flavor creamy caramel flavors are heavenly.  And as the ice melts it mellows out the flavor a little and it's still great. I can't say I have had all the cafe sua da in the valley but what I have had; this is my favorite.   Next time I come to Mesa for work I will need to come at lunch time so I can try the pho.
neg	This store is banking on the hope they are the only place to buy what they are selling. The mgr at the cash register was not only snobbish and unhelpful but down right rude. It is 12/21/12 I know Christmas time is tough for retail employees but I was at many other retail stores today and their mgrs and employees were extremely friendly. I spend approx 1/2 hour talking to a sales assoc who was very friendly and all was good until I got to register with the mgr and I ended up walking out without purchasing anything. I then went to my car and purchased desired items on amazon while in this stores.parking lot. I know business is good this time of year and maybe this companies business is always good. But the post office and Sears also used to be the king! I could explain all the facts of the situation but I am sure it would make no difference as I am confident this is the culture of this store.
pos	Hippies scare me.     So in my preparation to go to this place I ordered Xanax from an on-line Canadian pharmacy which I have been taking for three days now.  Bought a tazer from Spy Headquarters in case one of them tries to hold me down and pours patchouli oil on me.  The fifth of gin that I slammed in the parking lot really helped with that last bit of extra courage that I needed to partake my journey into hippie-land.  It was all for nothing. No hippies around just a teenager behind the counter.  This place is tiny and the counters are about at mouth level. I don't know how anyone under 7'6\" could easily eat off of them.    Anyways for $5 flat you get a kick ass burger a school lunch bag half full of well seasoned skin-on fries and a can of soda.   It's true that the fries could have been a bit more crispy but they tasted so good I got over it real quick.  I'd be afraid to ask what the special ingredient is because they might say \"it's organic don't panic\".    Jerry's dead but this place lives on.  Thanks hippies!
neg	I was so happy to see another station in the neighborhood.  I went in to fill up as I usually do at any station unaware that I was paying TEN CENTS MORE PER GALLON (than Circle K)  because I wasn't paying cash or using a Shell credit card.  Yes there are signs on the pump but really who would think to look for such a requirement?  I've been buying gas for over 40'years and have never seen such a non-cash penalty.  I and my children their spouses and our friends will not be getting gas there ever again.  How disappointing and dishonest.
pos	Man do I LOVE a restaurant with REALLY GOOD food and friendly service! Liberty Market is definitely that!   Funny thing is that I was originally going to eat at Joe's Farm Grill but ended up here (after a search here on YELP).  Nice laid back decor too.  You wait in line to place your order pay and they give you a stand with a number on it (like at Sizzler) then someone brings your order.  I like places that spend the time to make their own salad dressings and take care with creating a delicious salad. The Italia was DELICIOUS and a perfect size! The homemade Minestrone soup was loaded with fresh ingredients and was REALLY fantastic too!  I forgot to try one of their desserts...the last Red Velvet cupcake was ALMOST snatched up by another customer but the Food Server was so kind to offer to get it to me (maybe I had a look of panic on my face??)...WOW!! This service is rare to find!  The restrooms are quite amusing! Saw a similar set-up in NYC. Each toilet/water-closet is individual...no stalls. They were VERY CLEAN too (ok I was seriously apprehensive that it might smell like a men's restroom since it was all unisex...no worries!!!!)  I can't wait to visit here again...but after I check out their other place across the street: Joe's Real BBQ. YUM!
neg	not clean worst gel manicure ever and ruined my nails--Jimmy finished it --his wife started it.  Nails sanded too thin and they talk to other people and look away while they'e filing sanding and cutting.  They cut two times now into the side of my thumb nail which causes it to catch and tear off the same day or soon.  Their 10 or 12-yr old daughter brought the colors to pick (she is much too precocous to be customer focused--she's narcisstic and I want an adult waiting on me).  They have to open bottles to look at gel color--no samples.  Gel drying machine is sitting on a priority mail box on top of chair in customer wait area.   Pedicure okay.  Won't come back.  This place like many with Vietnamese want your money they don't understand service (or cleanliness in this one) and why we really come to these places.  They also try and nickle and dime you on price for instance give you a deal to take off gel from previous manicure when you're getting a new gel manicure.  They want to use the dremel to sand your nails down to the quick.  How about healthy nails and return visit.  This place I'm surprised stays in business.  Sadly it's not in a category by itself although the others are cleaner.  Jimmy should stay away from nails and customers and just keep quiet.  The girl might be cute to some customers but I am not coming to have a 12-year old wait on me.  No thank you.
pos	Great experience from start to finish.  Host (who was the owner) seated us at a table with a view.  Was given house made foccacia bread and olive oil.  Was awesome.  Some of the best bread I've ever had before a meal.  The olive oil was seasoned perfectly too.  My grandma got the burger and I got the pesto penne primavera.  The pasta came with shrimp squash and some other vegetables.  I love pesto so this hit the spot.  Good serving size but not too much.  The food tasted fresh.  They make their own pasta which was delicious.  The burger was huge.  Looked like you get your moneys worth.  The ice tea was even good.  The place was clean and sleek.  They played good music and the service was perfect.  It has been a while since I had such a good overall experience with no complaints.  I will be coming back.  The host who we later found out was the owner was working that night and asked us how we liked everything.  I've said it before but that is a rare and good touch for any restaurant.  Well done.
neg	Bad customer service!    No one at the front desk for thirty minutes.  Plus they left the phone on the counter so when I tried to call their number phone just kept ringing and ringing.  :(
pos	Great customer service competitive rates and I always get a call right back from Jeff! Nice to have an agent who actually cares about his customers. I would recommend giving him a call.
neg	What's with the cheese?  It isn't even Velveta.  It's liquid cheese food and it belongs somewhere other than on my burger.  $5 burger and fries is a great deal IF -- IF -- it's a great deal.  This is just liquid cheese food on a hamburger patty.  McDonald's will do a burger and fries for $5 that's tastier than this dump.
pos	We went to The Farm today for lunch to enjoy a picnic on such an awesome beautiful day. I had the Tuscan sandwich and it was awesome. I had expected it to be good but was surprised at just how enjoyable it really was. I'm sure sitting outside in beautiful surroundings on a perfect day helped with the experience. This is the prefect place for lunch on a beautiful day. My date was equally impressed so I'm sure I will be back!
neg	The organization is grand with a ton of selection but the employees could care less about costumer service.   It is very amazing with the amount of unemployed people in the city they have to hire the most incompetent individuals....   I'm not going to be ignorant and say they are ALL bad but a few in the bunch seem to make it difficult to be a repeat costumer.   Try talking to a manager at this location and you will be routed around the store till you finally get some one that states \"the manager is off till next week.\"   i will stay a website purchaser until they change their policy at this location and hire individuals with a better standard
pos	Screw Disneyland- Sephora is the happiest place on earth!  They have everything a girly girl or a girly guy could possibly dream of and then some! They have all the best brands in cosmetics skin care and perfume and they're always adding new items to their extensive product selection.  To me getting a gift card to Sephora is like having Christmas morning over and over again.  Everywhere you look there are sparkly blushes lip plumping glosses lash-extending mascaras and anti-aging face creams- what more could anyone ask for? I can understand why men might hate going into Sephora- but they do have some products for guys too- although not many.  As far as I know Scottsdale Fashion Square is home to the only Sephora in Scottsdale but even as great as it is it still can't beat the one right on the strip in Vegas.  They're open really late and you can shop with a drink in your hand- what could be better than that?
neg	This is my very first review and I can't say I feel bad for what I am about to write. I took everyones review hoping for a really good hotdog and onion rings like the reviews I read (best hot dog ever amazing hotdog. etc) oh man were we disappointed.  I'd have to say I'd go to cocstco for a hotdog for $1.50 with a drink.
pos	I loved this little slice of heaven.  Reasonable prices tiny dining room very personal service.  Pablo was laid back but with only 4 couples in the small establishment he did a great job of making sure we were taken care of.
neg	I went today to meet my daughter for lunch.  We are both big sushi enthusiasts.  The interior and atmosphere was beautiful.  Well appointed. The service was excellent.  We ordered edamame was good...nothing to rave about.  Not much you can do to mess that up.  Drinks were well poured but exspensive for what you got.  Ordered five different sushi rolls. All five were bland not much flavor and stale.  The fish was not fresh. Paid $12 for a soft shell crap roll and it tasted days old.  Will not go back. Did here they have good pizza and a happy hour at three.  My daughter says to give it another try.  We'll see... I'll let you know if I do.
pos	AZ-88 is at once chic urban fun and just enough Scottsdale without making me want to stab myself in the face as a t-shirt-and-jeans-wearing overweight guy.  You'll first notice the atmosphere and with good reason--it's perfectly lit with noticeable but not mind-numbingly blaring music and even better they have a live DJ who goes through no small trouble to beat match and keep things rolling throughout your Wednesday-Saturday evening dining experience. When I first hit AZ-88 it had an enormous deconstructed NY taxicab suspended from the ceiling which was a fantastical conversation piece. The wall behind the bar was completely covered in names and numbers. (I was far too proud when I accurately guessed that they were the names of cabbies and the numbers were their license numbers.) Overall a very different fun look.  Comfortable chairs and very full cocktails abound and while they typically have a rock-steady delivery more than a little cosmo has ended up in my friend's purse to her chagrin. That aside the food is fantastic and even though it's a bit hard to get out of here for under $30 per person (because you simply must try the cheesecake and drinks are pushing $14) it's worth it as a classy-but-casual night out that you can really enjoy.  They have a great patio the burger is dripping with flavor (and in fact cheese) and they have waffle fries with pretty much everything. Great salads and sandwiches help round things out and they ship their cheesecake in from Carnegie Deli in New York which is just about the most perfect cheesecake you'll have the good chance to try. Forget that Cheesecake Factory nonsense these people know how a cheesecake is done. It is rich thick with just a hint of sour and an amazing flavor that takes your tongue hostage and demands whipped cream ransom.  Overall a wonderful place for drinks and good food with friends and the staff is pointed but efficient and will throw back any shit you give them in good humor or as appropriate not. (We've never run afoul of that rule but you wouldn't want to I assure you.)
neg	35 minutes... No food. You be the judge.
pos	Fun with caps if I did that sort of thing. The whole experience was great (you won't get any specifics this review is 3 weeks after I can't remember sorry). Service was by that waitress who does everything perfectly. Explain food wine doesn't stay too long. Nice interesting big room decor. Looking forward to the next time.
neg	I am not a fan of this place. I like to try to stay positive though so here is my attempt a the proverbial \"positive sandwich\"  Top Bun: The location is fantastic. I really like where it is its a cute little place that is very easy to find.  The Meat of the Matter: The food here is odd. I am very open to trying new things and experiencing different cultures. As I have mentioned in other reviews I love all types of food from all over the world. I didn't care for this place. I ordered an appetizer that was wrapped in a banana leaf and i honestly thought I was eating an ashtray. It wasn't good. The pad thai that I sampled was very lifeless. I had a friend get a big bowl of soup that looked good but i didn't try it.   Lettuce onions pickles tomato: The service was not good. I sat at the bar the first time I went here and we got ignored for the most part. The bartender (who i believe doesn't work there anymore luckily) sniffed at me when I asked for clarification on something. There are also jars of really weird floating things at the bar (probably pickled/preserved veggies/meat/fruits etc.) it was unappetizing to be around....I don't have a weak stomach at all it was just odd. The second time I went in the service was equally as bad. there was a table of 8 of us for lunch and the place was mostly dead and I had to go up and ask them to take our order after we sat waiting for 30 minutes. Subsequently the menu is small and the prices are high with not much room for substitutions or changes  Bottom bun: I like the owner he is really nice and friendly. The cooks were also friendly. I like to believe that my taste buds merely didn't care for this place. I know a lot of people that have very positive things to say about this place. I will not recommend it as a personal favorite and I will quite frankly probably avoid it unless it is specifically requested by a client. I am completely fine with the concept that not everyone has to like the same things. I personally have not had a good experience with this place but I respect the fact that a majority of the reviewers for it have.
pos	Who dosen't like Cosco I love this place. The pizza is cheap and good.
neg	If it wasn't for the bad food I would go here more than once or twice a year.  The meat was dry and tough in my first entree and not edible in my second. Now when my wife drags me here to watch a movie I order a salad only. Because they do catering I have a suspicion that they serve up left over food from catered events to their restaurant customers.    The service is OK. They have a couple of generic draft beers. Everything is overpriced.  Caveat Emptor if you order an entree.
pos	A group of us from the IVAA Summit went to Zinburger last night. The food & service was great! I think we scared our poor server (Mike) but he was wonderful!
neg	This was absolutely horrible. I got the supreme pizza with the mystery meats.  I threw it in the trash. I will wait until I get to my destination to eat. Horrible!!!
pos	I love this restaurant (even though it's a chain and I can hear my brother saying it's just a \"glorified Red Lobster\").   I ordered the Crab and Lobster Bisque soup and am drooling thinking about how much I wish I could eat it right now. For my entree I ordered the Atlantic Salmon (stuffed with crab shrimp and brie cheese) which was unbelievably amazing. I also had some scalloped potatoes which was basically in the shape of a brick covered with cheesy goodness. I wanted to eat the apple pie for dessert because it looked so delicious but could barely breathe after eating all that food.   The service was outstanding although the manager stopping by the table several times throughout dinner was annoying.   I can't wait to come back here.
neg	Yeah...notsomuch.  Sprinkles is sooooooooo not worth the wait . Or the chaos. Or the hype. Or the attitude from the morons who work there. Other things that are terrible about Sprinkles include...  - The cupcakes are not that great. I ordered two. The vanilla was okay the cinnamon was dry and chalky and I really disliked it.  - This place is a disorganized mess.   - There is no rhyme or reason to any of the ordering process. My friends and I were carefully watching the ordering process and we actually think they decided to choose the dumbest and most irrational methods to take orders and dispense cupcakes. Just stupid.  - The owners must have purposely only hired people who cannot think for themselves or make decisions. No sane person could possibly work here without being like \"um...there might be a better way to do this...\"  - Also the employees were rude. Did I mention dumb?  So get this: I attempted to order a bottle of water. I told the clerk it's 100+ degrees outside I walked there and I'm realllllllly thirsty. The idiot at the counter told me \"You can order a water here but you must wait for your name to be called to receive the water and pay for it.\" I pointed out that the water was RIGHT THERE and there wasn't anyone currently paying or using the register. Couldn't she just sell me a water? She said \"NO\" and proceeded to WRITE DOWN MY ORDER (just the word \"water\") on a cupcake order slip. She then told me to stand there and wait for my name to be called so she could HAND ME THE WATER and then ring me up.  I was all sorts of thirsty and all sorts of moody that day so I got really ghetto on her ass and was all like OH HELLLLLL-TO-THE-NO!\"   I said \"It's quite simple. Just hand me the water and I will hand you money. End of discussion.\" (There are the actual words out of the mouth!)  She looked really mad and also possibly terrified of me and my 5'4\" 110 lbs of fury. Thankfully she handed me my water so I did not have to stab her. Which was good because I was waaaaaaaaay too thirsty to stab anyone.   I must be properly hydrated in order to commit crimes of passion. And I'm mad crazy passionate about my cupcakes yo.
pos	On one of my many visits to see mi amore he took me to this fantastic little pizza joint. The aesthetics of the place were overwhelmingly perfect. I believe the maximum seating capacity of the dining area is 45 yes folks 45. So the 2 1/2 hour wait was expected and very VERY worth it. The pizzas are baked to order in a classic brick house oven. The toppings arent what youd find in your local Pizza Hut either. You can choose from fresh slices of mozzarella slices of perfectly seasoned italian sausage pepperoni slices salami slices arugula fresh basil leaves tomatoes etc. Basically what Im getting at is this is beyond words delicious classic LEGIT Italian pizza. Around the dining area you will see freshly baked loaves of focaccia bread that is later served to you with extra virgin olive oil for dipping once you are seated. The smell in that place is heavenly.....incredibly reminiscent of my grandmothers kitchen!!  PS GET THERE EARLY!!
neg	I (like others) am at a loss as to why this place has such a good overall review. tasteless and awful
pos	The pizza is my favorite in Phoenix.  It is light airy and tasty and does not give you that \"I am reading to explode as my cotton mouth is making me drink two liters of water every half hour\" feeling.  The ingredients are fresh and delicious.    I am hooked!
neg	Boy is the name a temptation.Seriously :)  I'll try to be fair though but I'm writing at a time were this restaurant was truly life changing. So much so that I'm buying a dining room table additional gear for the kitchen and not frequenting any chain while I'm in my hometown based on the strength of this experience. Even in a good mood this place wouldn't be breaking a 2.5 . I'm not in a good mood.    Texas cheese fries. Pretty tastelessmess of uncrisp steak fries that are meant to be Monterrey jack  cheddar and bacon. Either the cheese mixed itself together really well or that's not what I had. Bacon  mm that is a very generous term for the toe nail clippings of meat that ended up atop it. Saving grace was only ordering 1/2 an order.  Kid's meal.  Holy crap dried and scraggly carrots accompanied the most basic hot dog imaginable on the most generic bun. No refill offered this time on drink no straw either.   By far the most cynical  kid's meal I've met. Sure make a profit but don't take the piss!  Fresh carrots are not hard to do  with white film on them.. sorry you've just earned a  1 star. Should have walked out didn't. :(   Entrees.  Cajun steak . Claims to be marinated in spices that I couldn't find. They may indeed have shown them a picture of the process in the recipe but I couldn't find it. Meant to be medium rare but was medium on one side  rare on the other close though:)   Sirloin steak. Cooked as requested  a bit over seasoned.   Sides: Twice baked potato.  If you ever want to open up a salt mine these guy will do it for you. You want an idea of what it's texture was?  Twice chewed would be a better name. Warm vomit with bacon bits would be  a slightly more colorful and chunky term.  Fried onions:   came with whatever was stuck to the grill they came from.The mushrooms were the only thing that were as tasteful as expected. They looked very consistent though  canned?   Never mind they were edible:   Steak soupreally more a stewbut tasted pretty good.  Overall service was ok'ish but walking the kid to the toilet twice the staff just seemed  to want to get to where they wanted to go and not care for the toddler walking up the aisle to the restroom in front of me.  ( that's for this occasion only  past two times it's been great fun for the kid)  1.5 rounded to 1 for the carrots.
pos	I was a regular at Mia's first location in Wrigleyville/Chicago. Scott (the original founder/chef and present owner) is the reason Mia Francesca is what it is. Not sure if us folks up here in Scottsdale know how lucky we are he landed on our door step. Food service vibe...if I could give it six stars I would.
neg	When I was in highschool various clubs used to sell Karsh's bagels around campus to raise money. I would buy a bagel and cream cheese and hide it in my backpack to munch on during class. Soooo good!  I was feeling nostalgic one day and decided to pop in for a bagel and cream cheese.  The guy behind the counter was nice enough I told him my order which came to $2.95 or something just barely under $3.  I had failed to notice the sign which said they do not accept credit cards for purchases under $3. I apologized and said I didn't have any cash and offered to run the the ATM.  The guy behind the counter very nicely asked other lady behind the counter  (the owner? manager on duty maybe?) if she would let me use my card. She looked right at me all stink-eyed and said \"No\" and returned to what she was doing. No apology no \"I'm sorry but there is an ATM at so and so....\" Very curt.  Thanks a lot personality plus! I will not be returning and I hope you choke on a matzo ball.  Shame too I loved those bagels.
pos	Excellent service and food             enjoyed live music on patio
neg	First off the restaurant is dim and dark.. I thought the decor was a little off because they were going for a tropical Vietnam theme with banana trees in there and a waterfall fountain. The waiter there did not have a smile and didn't seem freindly it looked like this was the last place he wanted to be at. The service sucked ass. I mean come on there was only two tables including mines and 3.9/4 of the time he didn't check up on us or refilled our water and we had to walk up to ask for our bill.. like seriously...? Are you that lazy. Bun Bo Hue was skimpy on the meat and had little veggies on the side. Pho had a rancid smell. Noodles in my sister's bun thit nuong were hard and watery (seemed like they were super old) Overall I wouldn't recommend to ANYBODY.
pos	Love Krista!
neg	We went to American Junkie after we found a 50\% discount from http://www.restaurant.com. They couldn't pay us to go back.  If you like velvet ropes not being able to talk to the person next to you because the music is so loud and being around people who are really into themselves American Junkie is your spot.
pos	I attended one of her classes for pressure cookers and had to leave with one. Luckily she offers great discounts after her classes!  Since then I have also gotten a bosch mixer (don't know how I lived without one all these years!) and also a wheat grinder. Everytime I go in here I find something I can't live without!  Shar has great classes and tips on how to utilize all her products. Well worth it to attend a class. I just wish the store was closer to Glendale!  So glad I found shar's now my family enjoys homemade wheat bread and pizzas and all sorts of yummy things that are good for them too!
neg	Avoid at all costs. Awful service slow as hell only uses disposable plasticware/plates to add landfill insult to heinous food.  Despite telling them we were in a rush to catch a plane and multiple reassurances that the food would arrive in plenty of time they lollygagged around and I ended up paying $30 to be seriously pissed off and hungry with no food.   BLECH.
pos	Need fig preserves? They've got it. Fennel? It's beautifully packed on ice and extremely fresh in the produce department. Need boneless pork loin roast from the blade end? The butcher has your back. Duck fat? Just take a peek in the freezer section. Sometimes it's the little things that normally go unnoticed that gets you five stars...  AJ's closed early the other night in lieu of the holidays and I ran around to FOUR different stores looking for something as simple as whole grain mustard and fennel. I came up empty handed on both items. I say \"simple\" items - but it's amazing when you rely on a grocer like this as much as I do and realize that most items are out of reach otherwise. AJ's carries practically anything my culinary desires could ask for!  Although I had to wait a day to go shopping again and to make the recipe i was wanted it was during my adventures to the 4 stores that I realized how much I truly appreciate this grocer. How is it I can get wireless internet via laptop on the I-10 freeway courtesy of my phone company but can't find fennel within a 10 mile radius?  This my friends is why I love AJ's. And as someone who watches America's Test Kitchen as though it were food porn I can say that any other grocer doesn't stand a chance against Eddie Bashas' high end store.  You truly do get what you pay for. For all the employees at AJ's I say \"THANK YOU!!\" for the great service you provide and the products you offer.
neg	I got my nails done there last Thursday for the first and last time. I would never ever go back there. The man who did my nails burnt two of my fingers really bad. The place was dirty and messy and talk about noisy he asked me to many personal questions. To top it off he answered his cell phone and talked on it about 10mins all load and on speaker phone . So rude and bad customer service. It might be a little cheaper there but as the saying goes u get what u pay for!!!!!!!
pos	Love me some hidden house!   The music is too loud. The drinks too cheap. The clientele too local. But I've never had anything but a good time there. Whether it's karaoke or weird shit on the weekends you'll have fun if you don't expect it to be Merc cuz Merc it ain't. And not for one moment in it's life has it pretended to be. But I love it for what it is and that's an experience.
neg	I am DONE with Classic Car Spa their sub-par car washes and their shady business partnerships.    Whatever you do DO NOT get your windshield replaced by the Auto Glass Shop that Classic Car Spa allows on their premises. I am holding Classic Car Spa accountable for placing their customers in such close proximity to criminals.   While these Auto Glass Shop men are friendly and seem helpful it is a scam. They replaced my windshield (and hey it cost me nothing b/c my insurance covers it) and put the glass in wrong THREE TIMES! After one week and many HOURS on the phone with them and my insurance company they are still giving me the run around. So although it was free I will now have to foot the bill for fixing their crappy craftsmanship.   After trying in vain to get my windshield fixed by the Auto Glass Shop I spoke with the manager of Classic Car Spa. I don't think I've ever met a manager with a more relaxed \"who cares?\" attitude. That place is a joke. Except I'm not laughing....
pos	Cowboy Ciao is one my favorite restaurants in Old Town Scottsdale.  To start with they share a wine list with Kazimierz.  My favorite menu item is the Stetson Chopped salad.  My only wish is that the serving was bigger!  I can't get enough...and I'm too embarrassed to order two.  The flavors in this salad are amazing!  Smoked salmon Israeli cous cous creamy dressing.  For dinner I actually like the Exotic Mushroom Pan Fry.  The tastes are really unique and I got to try mushrooms I hadn't had before.  It's great!  I did try the Bacon Peanut Brittle for dessert and I cannot recommend this.  It was not good at all.  It just makes the brittle really greasy and then you run into chunks of bacon...ick.  Thank God my husband ordered the Chocolate/Peanut Butter pot pie so I could steal from him!
neg	Don't waste your time...Arrowhead mall on the other side of town is so much better!
pos	Great Mexican food.  Authentic street tacos plus a full menu of tasty dishes.  Halibut tacos remind me of Ensenada Michelada with Pacifico beer is a perfect beverage for any dish.
neg	I can overcome the hipster sneer and accept that I am an uncool blemish in a world full of cut-off corduroys and patterned leggings. What I cannot and will not get over is an unapologetic staff whose epic error led to me breaking 5 years of meatless eating because of an order mishap.  I ordered the red pepper tomato quiche. After 20 minutes waiting for the quiche to warm in what appeared to be a 200 degree oven I double checked to make sure my name was on the plate at the counter. When I dug in for the first bite a wave of nausea and panic washed over my after realizing this was a piece of the bacon spinach quiche. I returned to the counter and explained that I had ordered the vegetarian quiche and the chic who took my order asked the chic behind the counter which one she served because she was sure she got it right. The chic in the kitchen said she put them out in the order she got them. Then they spent some time looking around in confusion and murmuring a bit  meanwhile all the quiche had been sold. So the counter chic simply turned to me and send \"well we don't have anymore of that one.\"  Thanks. I told her I was more upset about the fact that I had just put bacon in my mouth after 5 years of no meat than there being no more quiche. She did give me my money back but no one apologized or offered me any recompense. I'm over you being cooler than me but I'm not over you having no soul.
pos	What a fabulous dining experience! My boyfriend and I are always looking for new places to try and came upon this place on Yelp when our regular Saturday spot decided to no longer be opened for lunch Saturdays. Right upon entering we were greeted by someone behind the register and he sat us down at a booth. The decor was great and the place was spotless. We ordered the Saturday special of Monte Cristo the potatoes and the biscuits and gravy among other items. The Monte Cristo was perfection and the home made blueberry and strawberry jam was excellent! The potatoes were seasoned to perfection and eggs cooked perfectly. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone and this is now going to be our regular weekend breakfast/brunch place.
neg	Hey Thai Elephant! Stop sucking! You used to be so good. Why is my egg roll cold? Why don't I get a fork with my food.... after asking!? Why won't you make me the Tiger on Fire for lunch when I got it last week for lunch?... AND it's on the menu! When did you decide to cut my curry portion in half almost? When did your service start sucking? Hey every person that decided that my two top was not important enough to attend! Why did it take 10 minutes to order my drink and then an additional ten minutes to actually get my drink? By the way Tiger beer is on your menu. If you are not going to actually offer it then you need to take it off your menu. I can't believe it's come to this... I used to love you. You broke my heart for the last time.
pos	I was sad to come back to lai lai's and they no longer had the Mongolian :( boo but i took my mom there and we were starving so we decided to order off the menu. My mom is allergic to  msg and they helped us with what we should order. and she didn't get sick!! woo hoo.. we ordered three dishes and an appetizer to share between her  my bf and myself and we stilll brought food home and I dont think we spent over $30 bucks for all that food!! it was very good to! i love good cheap food!! Ill be back they are always friendly.
neg	I took my family here and this was a disappointin experience. The service was snobby and rude.  The waitress was condescending and the food was overprices. I have not been to the other Tomasos but I will clearly discourage anyone from dining at the Chandler Tomasos. The service is clearly substandard and snobby.
pos	Very good. My wife and I stopped by randomly on our way back and had beef pho and veggie pho. I eat large portions and this is the first time ever I didn't finish a bowl of pho. If in the area we will stop again for sure.
neg	False ads do not stay there. Unless you don't mind a dirty smelly overrated hotel. The sheets and towels that were supposed to be white were gray. The place is run down and poorly serviced. The front lobby is clean but once you head up to your room you quickly find out that the place is run down and not being taken care of. I stayed on the fifth floor \"cabana suites\" and as soon as my elevator opened up on the fifth floor I knew right away I stayed at the wrong place. The \"suites\" were nothing more than a room with a tiny bit of extra elbow space that are on the rooftop area with a pool in the front of the room. The pool was NASTY! (see pictures I uploaded) It was green and looked disgusting and when I arrived to take a look it had an \"out of order\" sign placed at the entrance. This place was embarrassing! I had told my brothers to book there with me because we thought it was going to be a great hotel based on their website but we were very disappointed again!
pos	Went here today Sunday about 8:50 and it was crowded but not to bad about 1/2 hour wait. Im warning you now dont ask how much longer after you put your name in if they told you how long when you checked in.   About 10am is when it really got packed just about when we got done. I ordered the chicken and waffles and i really liked it. I asked for some butter for my waffle because it didnt come with any and it made the dish perfect for me. The chicken had great flavor and when you take a bite with the waffle and butter and the syrup heaven. I tried some bites without the butter and it wasnt even close to be the same for me.  My grandma got some omellete and she gave me some because she knew she wouldnt finish it and i would order that also. The omelletes are pretty good size but my wifes dish my sons and mine where not that much food especially for $9. We are use to getting enough food for 2 when you eat at breakfast places and slighty cheaper. Not complaining because it was good but be ready.  There was 2 guys sitting next to use and trying to eat there 30 minute food challange. big ass egg plate with bacon and hash browns they both only made thru about halfway.  I would definilty go back and get the same stuff. I also got a lemonade with mint and it was just right. My son really didnt like his reese's pancakes. Id like to go back and try some of this stuff ham steak w/ gravy chicken fried steak w/ hashbrowns bannana pecan caramel french toast
neg	No I simply cannot put in a good review for Miracle Mile.  A coworker recommended this place to me. Actually two coworkers did. However upon inspection of my pie right before I was about to eat it I noticed that there was mold in it.  Yes mold.  Sorry Miracle Mile your fries were bland and while your chicken tenders were decent I can't forgive mold in a pie. I did take a picture of it so I will be adding it to this review as soon as I can.  Who knows if I will get my 2.95 for moldy pie back.  *ETA MM has been notified and I am to receive a gift certificate for my 2.95. I was given the option of returning it but it's over a 40 min drive.
pos	Love this location at Gainey Ranch! Great food consistently!
neg	Food poisoning alert. There is no doubt in my mind that this incident was caused by the order of potato skins I was served at this un-fine dining establishment. First off the cook looks like somebody off the street at least wear an apron buddy.     Now we are watching the games there and it's about 30 minutes after I eat 4 fairly large skins which I dipped in sour cream and the rumbling in the stomach started. Five minutes later I was depositing those skins in their tiny toilet and trying to hold on while the games ended. Lastly another stop was needed on way home to drop off some more skins. This place is full of local drunks but a good watering hole (yeah literally). Go here to drink and stay away from all food. Also it was 8 bucks for one order of skins. Why do places charge the same price for apps as they do for sandwiches. It's another sign of a clueless place with poor food and hygiene. Bad choice.
pos	Our server Gary was awesome. Food was amazing...an experience.
neg	Not worth the money. Food was average and the portion was small for the price I paid.
pos	We started each morning of our vacation at The Breakfast Club.  Everything was so tasty; juices are fresh-squeezed.  Menu has quite a variety and portions are very filling  It gets busy early.  Be sure to give it a try.
neg	Glad this place has new ownership... I should probably remove the review below Its really harsh and doesn't apply to the NEW establishment.  You have been warned ;)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Short Review:  THIS PLACE SUCKS BALLS  Long Review: We were supposed to meet a friend here at Draft House on Saturday night. We were excited to be out on a date-like experience cuz its been a while. We went to my in-laws for dinner and then headed to Draft... I knew it was going to be interesting from the sound of the music as we pulled into the strip mall.   The music: Good music probably the only good thing about this place - if you're a hip-hop fan. All hip-hop all night.   The crowd: Ghetto fab all the way! Seems like everyone there is late 20's - early 30's (and some older sprinkled throughout the crowd) and none realize its not 1996 anymore. Expect to hear a lot of fake accents a la Da Bronx and a lot of misuse of slang terms. It was entertaining until it became annoying. Oh and people WILL steal your seats or tell you they are saved - ugh!  The atmosphere: small crowded...  Small dance floor.  A couple pool tables but don't expect to get one. Some TVs playing various sports which I guess qualifies this place as a \"sports cafe\"??   The service: OMG we had one beer each and the \"line\" was retarded over 30 minutes to tab out. No line in sight just people crowding together trying to get to the front of the line.  Oh! and LOL.. the bar tenders are total morons one of them complained to the guy next to us about his crappy tip and the other argued with his customer about whether they ordered rum and cokes or redbull and vodka.  The guy had already made the rum and cokes and was pissed that HE got it wrong.  Weirdos!  If any of this appeals to you this is your place!   BTW her friend didn't show and we ended up going to Skip n Jan's to play some pool :o)  We had a great time there :o)
pos	I had other piercings done here and then went out of state and got my nose pierced with a friend and when i got back I was having problems with it. I went in and talked to them and they changed out the stud for me gave me a discount on the jewelry and were really fun friendly professional and very informative. This place is top notch. Won't go to another place for my piercings again! No way! It is very clean and these guys know their stuff! Really impressed...I could go on and on! I won't get my jewelry anywhere else either...they have a a great variety and if they don't have something you want they order it easy peasy. Love it!
neg	I will precede this lackluster review by stating the following:  1)I have only been to this place once. 2)I didn't get a chance to actually try the cuisine. 3)I am a sympathetic person to servers as I have been one.  That being said I give this place one star for reasons of poor service.  About six months ago at around 4pm on a Sunday afternoon we decided to eat at this place. The atmosphere was warm and cozy; typical college bar with college-aged waitresses.  We made sandwich selections and ordered happy hour beers. The beers came the food never did and we watched other patrons come in eat and leave.  All the while our waitress never came by to give us an explanation or even get us another round of drinks (we got them ourselves from the bar).   Since my bf and I both worked in food service we are always sympathetic when we can see that a place is under-staffed.  But after an hour of waiting we finally crossed the room to speak with our server. She said \"I can't imagine it will be much longer.\" I think the more professional approach would have been an apology and admitting to forgetting to put in our ticket which is what we gathered when we saw her speaking frantically with the cook.  Where was the manager that day? Or someone who noticed that we sat there so long without our food or any communication at all?  We left money on the table for our beers and walked out. I guess there is a first time for everything.
pos	The food here is awesome every time I come here we have a great time And the waitress kimberly Couldn't ask for better waitress
neg	Went to Fatburger with our family tonight and will not return.   Average food. The burgers were average. The lettuce was wilted the tomato was green and nothing outstanding about the flavor. I'd say better options nearby are Joe's farm grill In-n-out or Culvers.   Cleanliness was average. The floor was a little sticky and the beverage area was kept very neat. The kitchen appeared clean.   Service was below average/horrible. The cashier was very unpleasant. We all ordered at the same time and the first half of the food came out about 15 minutes prior to the 2nd part. It was pretty slow. By the time we got the fries they were cold. The staff literally acted like they were a bunch of highschoolers who were annoyed that there were any customers who interrupted their hangout.   I know this sounds harsh...it is. My experience was absolutely horrible. We will not be back and I don't recommend that you should either.
pos	OK I've decided that other coffee shops sell swill. I think about Dazbog coffee in a dreamy sort of way like unstressed people think about sex. I mourn often that they open so damn late in the morning. Seriously I would be there every day...   The chocolate cappuccino rocks my world and perks me right the hell up even on the mushiest afternoon. No bitterness not overly sweet just blissful- in an I've-just-been-bitch-slapped-by-caffeine sort of way of course.   Oh and the sandwiches I complained about? Replaced by real deli looking ones in clam-shells. Far more appetizing. But what the hell do I need a sandwich for when I can have a giant red velvet cupcake?   Don't make me break out the voodoo Dazbog. Just open at 6:00 am like any other coffee shop and we'll be BFFs.
neg	I was looking into gyms around the area. Upon entering I was greeted by the front desk guy. I asked about memberships and then he said \"Sorry we are sold out\". I stood there stunned. Then he snickered \"Just kidding\". Trying to be a good sport I went with it.   Next came the young sales guy. He was personable - at first anyways. Showed me around the gym and I was interested in joining. Next we went over to the childcare area since I have a little one. Children were in the room however the two girls monitoring the room were chatting it up with one another and ignoring the kids. Bad sign. I asked the girls if they were CPR certified and had fingerprinting and background checks. The world stopped for just a moment and they stared at me. I had interrupted their important conversation. Then they were both saying \"Yeah like well um no I mean yes\". In other words no straight answers.   We sat at the sales guy's desk and the wheeling and dealing began. I felt like I was purchasing a new car. \"If you choose option A you then can go to all the gyms.\" \"If you choose option B then only here\" . The whole time I could see the children's area and the kids were being completely ignored (and we are talking very little children). When I told the sales man I needed to think about it he switched into some type of Dr. Jekyll Mr. Hyde routine. \"Well you only have today to make a decision after that no price guarantee!!!\"   From there he was down right rude.  I walked out of there thinking what the heck just happened. Like Sarah G I felt horrible when I left this gym.  It was an awful experience. Ended up getting a membership at Tangible Fitness on 7th Street. They don't have the same amenities however it is locally owned and the people are very nice there.
pos	What's not to love? Herb n Flavors uses local high quality ingredients the food tastes GREAT and they are vegetarian vegan and gluten-free friendly! I especially liked their vegan spinach and artichoke dip! We will definitely be back soon : )
neg	Pho-yuck this place!   I was tricked in to going here with promises of great Vietnamese. I was ready for a culinary adventure and what I got was a ride in the fright house.   The Bánh xèo was so greasy I couldn't eat it it was literally served on a plate of grease.   The bun was about the same. It lacked flavor the rice noodles were slimy the spring roll was loaded with grease.   I ordered some sort of plum soda drink and it had a cup of salt on the bottom of the glass.  The service was horrible and I will not be back.
pos	Excellent New Mexico style food great hatch green chile.
neg	omg...hands down the worst chinese food I've ever had anywhere.  Stopped by for lunch with my wife.  I ordered their cashew chicken dish and my wife ordered the pad thai noodles with shrimp.  Barely edible.  Makes Panda Express look like gourmet chinese food.  Prior to Flo's the distinction of the worst chinese food went to a chinese restaurant in Nebraska...but that's Nebraska.  I'm chinese and live in San Francisco so know a thing or two about good chinese food.
pos	I love this location! The food is always great and the service is good. Wi-fi is a plus especially since I am going to school. I come here almost everyday. I recommend this location to everyone.
neg	We checked out RnR on Sunday (just a few days after opening.) In all fairness I have to agree with many of the other reviews. Even though they are new these things are fixable so hopefully the feedback will be taken in the appropriate vein. The building is very cool and the vibe was energetic on a sunny Sunday morning. There was an abundance of waiters but they seemed to be confused and frenetic without a real focus on the customer. The menu is very limited and our server had not eaten most of the items. He was struggling to explain. Our drinks took more than 15 minutes to arrive even though we saw them sitting at the bar for the entire time. Our water had just disappeared. Then the food. I ordered the grill cheese ( a rare treat and when I order it I want it good!). It was cold and overwhelmed by heavy bread. The cheese wasn't melted. I sent it back and they simply nuked it and brought it out. Icky. Our son wanted a kids cheeseburger and the staff kept coming back and forth not sure if there was a single burger or sliders for kids. It became comical after the third person came out. My husband ordered a salmon omelet with several additional fixings. The eggs tasted like box eggs and it was lackluster and flavorless. We even took the time to provide feedback to management but we got a weak smile and \"come back and try us again.\" He made no effort to \"make things right\" either by comping something else to taste or providing an incentive to come back. There are too many restaurants in town to have to go to one that is less than mediocre. The young crowd may enjoy it for the bar vibe it gives but the majority of the tables on Sunday am were families or middle aged and we saw similar responses at other tables.
pos	Awesome country club. Great new remodled gym heated Olympic pool for year round use.  Love the family like atmosphere plenty of planned family events/pool parties.   Only complaint wish members who didn't pay for the monthy tennis membership could still rent a court on a need by need basis.   Regardless courts are top notch great facilities and friendly staff.
neg	We decided to hit up the \"Wine Down Wednesday\" that was happenin' at Tastings courtesy of KYOT.  Here's what went wrong:  The event is from 6-8 so we arrived just a few minutes (3 maybe?) after 6 so we could get a spot just in case it was hoppin'.  We walked in and the hostess (she looks like she's possibly the manager or owner) asked if we were there for the event and then pointed us towards the back room where the event was being held.  We walked in and there were about 7 tables and there were people at them all already.  Talk about early bird gets the worm!  We had to wait for about 3-4 minutes for the waitress to finish with a table to find out if we could sit on the patio for the event.  She said yes and that she would be right out to help us.  In the meantime another woman and her friend also took up at a patio table nearby.  20 minutes later the hostess/owner/manager looking woman came out and asked if we had been helped yet.  We said no and she left only to return with a small happy hour flier menu which she just handed from a distance and didn't even come over to our table.  I know you're wondering why I would wait the 15 minutes but I really wanted to see just how bad the service was going to be and frankly I just wanted some good $2 wine.  It's been about 5 minutes and the same woman comes back with full detailed menus and I asked if the happy hour flier was the deals for the event and she said yes and then asked if we were ready to order.  Um you just gave us the menus 10 seconds ago...  By now I'm ready to just order and enjoy the meal deals from the event.  I look over the happy hour flier and I see some app deals.  They said there was a specialty appetizer menu.  Not so much but whatever.  I can deal with that.  Then I see the drink section.  The claim for the event was $2 glasses of wine.  I was excited to try some nice new wines on the cheap but again... not so much.  In reality it was $4 glasses of house wine which only consisted of three different wines that weren't really what I was looking for.  By now the other women that were outside decided to leave having had enough of this shenanigans.  We decided (after 30 minutes since we arrived) to go next door to Sprouts get some apps and have our own \"Wine Down Wednesday\" at home.  I bet there are plenty of people that will have good experiences here and continue to visit happily but this one experience has caused me to write them off for good (which I don't usually do after one instance).  I wish that I could actually review their wine and food but the service was so poor and substandard that it's not worth giving them my money.  I understand if the food isn't good at a restaurant - some are just better or more talented than others.  However any business can and should have good customer service.  I think this is where the cliched line of \"if I could give them less than 1 star I would\" comes in...  Oh yeah and I slapped down a \"You've been Yelped\" card as I left.  Take that Tastings!!
pos	This is probably the sweet I crave the most! Salted Butter Caramel! Yummmm! When I cant make it up to Scottsdale I stop by my local Whole Foods in Chandler and pick up a pint from the freezer section and it is just as good.
neg	Bad quality ingredients. I ordered a red curry beef and the beef was awful hard I tried to chew it for a minute and decided to give up.
pos	This was the first real ballet I have ever been to and I was so excited it was the Nutcracker! I have been wanting to see the Nutcracker for years.   Thanks to Lindsey and Yelp I had the opportunity to go and the performance was just stunning. When I walked in I noticed the lobby was beautifully decorated a gentleman reading a story to children and a ballet dancer posing for pictures. The bartenders we bought our drinks from was very friendly and accomodating.   I can't say enough about how beautiful the performance was from the dancers the sets the costumes etc. Just incredible. I may just take my daughter to see it with me this season....
neg	There was hair in the food. Not just 1 but 2 in the same Bhel Puri dish.  The whole experience was pretty bad. There is no indication of how you order your food and when you finally figure it out the food does not taste good. We checked sodas on the order sheet and when no sodas showed up we asked if we were supposed to go and find our own sodas from the front of the store and were told that that was the case.  Also the guy at the counter is down right dismissive.  Pani Puri was OK Papdi Chaat - boring no flavor Bhel Puri - boring and no flavor before we found the hairs  Not worth the trip.
pos	Great service
neg	I had never been to Rainforest Cafe and I'm glad that I got to try it because I love trying things at least once; however this will also be my last time going there. We'll start from the beginning:   The atmosphere was nice for the \"jungle\" but it was so loud that I could not hear my wife talking to me. I felt that I had to scream at her to talk. Our waitress was nice but didn't check on us often. We barely understood her either because she speak loud enough. We got our drinks (ten mins later) and my iced tea was good but my wife's chocolate shake was gross. Too much chocolate syrup and it was expensive!! We sent it back so she could get water another 10 mins later. Food delivery was quick and my burger was pretty good but it was plain and $12!! Jeez so expensive for something so plain!!! I got onion rings for an extra few dollars (they were okay but worth the extra few $$$). My wife got an extra plate of fries and they were a few bucks but they didn't give her more than ten! I like the atmosphere of the restaurant and the theme but they are completely over priced!!!! Not worth it at all! The food was mediocre but left me sick that night.   Not as amazing as I thought it would be after seeing it many times in Vegas...
pos	My favorite Starbucks in Mesa. It's not even the closest one to my home but worth the experience. GREAT staff.
neg	I don't like the pizza hear and if you go for lunch there are no specials by the slice.  The ranch tastes bottled and tastes gross.  The ingredients are not fresh but rather canned (also gross).  The chicken wings were not that great either.  The atmosphere was nice for a casual place with a couple of flat screen TV's on the wall.  I will not be going back to this place so hopefully they get better soon since Barro's pizza is going in the area soon.
